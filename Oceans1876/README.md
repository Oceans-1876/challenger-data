| inputId        | string     | An UUID v5 generated from the input string using globalnames.org DNS domain name as a seed. This UUID can be used as a distributed global unique identifier of the string and can be created independently in any popular programming language. Example: 2284b0d6-d965-5c39-ace5-3ef673da6691                                                      |
| input          | string     | An input name-string entered for the verification. Example: Pomatomus soltator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| matchType      | string     | Indicates the quality of verification. - **NoMatch** (no matched name found) - **Exact** (exact match to a canonical form or a verbatim string) - **Fuzzy** (fuzzy match to a canonical form) - **PartialExact** (match after removing last or middle epithets) - **PartiaFuzzy** (fuzzy partial match after removing some parts) Example: `Exact` |
| bestResult     | ResultData | A successsful match of input name-string to a record in a data-source. ResultData with the highest score appears as a best match. ResultData from a preferred data-sources are aggregated into preferredResults array. But we are not using this data.                                                                                             |
| dataSourcesNum | integer    | The number of data-sources where the string had a match to a scientific name and out of these, the best result is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| curation       | string     | The best type of curation level from matched data-sources. Possible values are - **NotCurated** - **AutoCurated** - **Curated** If this flag has a **NotCurated** value, it does not mean that original data-source is not curated, rather it means the curation level is not known to `gnames`.                                                   |

| curation               | string    | A curation level for the record's data-source. If data-source is known to be curated, there is less risk of misspelling of the matched name.

| recordId               | string    | The record ID of the `matchedName` from the data-source. If the data-source does not provide record ID, the ID is generated by gnames and is prepended with a `gn_` prefix.                                                                                                                                                                        |
