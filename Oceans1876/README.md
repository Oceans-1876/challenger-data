| inputId        | string     | An UUID v5 generated from the input string using globalnames.org DNS domain name as a seed. This UUID can be used as a distributed global unique identifier of the string and can be created independently in any popular programming language.

|                |
| bestResult     | ResultData | A successsful match of input name-string to a record in a data-source. ResultData with the highest score appears as a best match. ResultData from a preferred data-sources are aggregated into preferredResults array. But we are not using this data.                                                                                             |
| dataSourcesNum | integer    | The number of data-sources where the string had a match to a scientific name and out of these, the best result is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| curation       | string     | The best type of curation level from matched data-sources. Possible values are - **NotCurated** - **AutoCurated** - **Curated** If this flag has a **NotCurated** value, it does not mean that original data-source is not curated, rather it means the curation level is not known to `gnames`.                                                   |
