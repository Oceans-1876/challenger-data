        "description": "The Catalogue of Life (CoL) is an assembly of expert-based global species checklists with the aim to build a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, but for now, it probably includes just over 80% of the world's known species. The Catalogue of Life estimates 2.5M extant species on the planet recognised by taxonomists at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users may notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue. \n\n### What's new in this edition (June 2021)?\n\n#### 4 new checklists:\n* WoRMS Crinoidea\n* WoRMS Nematoda, Nemys\n* WoRMS Brachiopoda (it's a replacement for Brachiopoda by Emig & al.)\n* WoRMS Euphausiacea (it's a replacement for ETI Euphausiacea) \n\n#### 71 checklists have been updated:\n* ITIS (9th update since AC19; new sectors: family Smarididae, superfamily Calyptostomatoidea, infraorder Stenopodidea)\n* Alucitoidea (5th update)\n* Brassicaceae\n* CCW\n* Eumycetozoa.com\n* Pterophoroidea (4th update)\n* ReptileDB\n* Scarabs (10th update)\n* Systema Dipterorum\n* World Ferns (6th update)\n* World Plants (5th update)\n\n_including automated updates for:_\n* WoRMS Actiniaria\n* WoRMS Amphipoda\n* WoRMS Antipatharia\n* WoRMS Appendicularia\n* WoRMS Ascidiacea\n* WoRMS Asteroidea\n* WoRMS Bochusacea\n* WoRMS Brachypoda\n* WoRMS Brachyura\n* WoRMS Bryozoa\n* WoRMS Cephalochordata\n* WoRMS Ceriantharia\n* WoRMS Cestoda\n* WoRMS Chaetognatha\n* WoRMS Copepoda\n* WoRMS Corallimorpharia\n* WoRMS Ctenophora\n* WoRMS Cubozoa\n* WoRMS Cumacea\n* WoRMS Echinoidea\n* WoRMS Foraminifera\n* WoRMS Gastrotricha\n* WoRMS Gnathostomulida\n* WoRMS Holothuroidea\n* WoRMS Hydrozoa\n* WoRMS Isopoda\n* WoRMS Kinorhyncha\n* WoRMS Leptostraca\n* WoRMS Loricifera\n* WoRMS Merostomata\n* WoRMS MilliBase \n* WoRMS Mollusca\n* WoRMS Monogenea\n* WoRMS Mystacocarida\n* WoRMS Myxozoa\n* WoRMS Nemertea\n* WoRMS Octocorallia\n* WoRMS Oligochaeta\n* WoRMS Ophiuroidea\n* WoRMS Orthonectida\n* WoRMS Ostracoda\n* WoRMS Placozoa\n* WoRMS Polychaeta\n* WoRMS Polycystina\n* WoRMS Porifera\n* WoRMS Priapulida\n* WoRMS Pycnogonida\n* WoRMS Remipedia\n* WoRMS Rhombozoa\n* WoRMS Scleractinia\n* WoRMS Scyphozoa\n* WoRMS Staurozoa\n* WoRMS Tanaidacea\n* WoRMS Tantulocarida\n* WoRMS Thaliacea\n* WoRMS Thermosbaenacea\n* WoRMS Trematoda\n* WoRMS Turbellarians\n* WoRMS Xenoturbellida\n* WoRMS Zoantharia",

        "description": "<p>The GBIF Backbone Taxonomy is a single, synthetic management classification with the goal of covering all names GBIF is dealing with.          It&#39;s the taxonomic backbone that allows GBIF to integrate name based information from different resources, no matter if these are occurrence datasets, species pages, names from nomenclators or external sources like EOL, Genbank or IUCN. This backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names from one source to another.</p><p>It is updated regulary through an automated process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point also providing the complete higher classification above families. Additional scientific names only found in other authoritative nomenclatural and taxonomic datasets are then merged into the tree, thus extending the original catalogue and broadening the backbones name coverage.          The GBIF Backbone taxonomy also includes identifiers for Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) drawn from the barcoding resources iBOL and UNITE.</p><p>International Barcode of Life project (iBOL), Barcode Index Numbers (BINs).  BINs are connected to a taxon name and its classification by taking into account all names applied to the BIN and picking names with at least 80% consensus. If there is no consensus of name at the species level, the selection process is repeated moving up the major Linnaean ranks until consensus is achieved.</p><p>UNITE - Unified system for the DNA based fungal species, Species Hypotheses (SHs).  SHs are connected to a taxon name and its classification based on the determination of the RefS (reference sequence) if present or the RepS (representative sequence). In the latter case, if there is no match in the UNITE taxonomy, the lowest rank with 100% consensus within the SH will be used.</p><p>The GBIF Backbone Taxonomy is available for download at http://rs.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/ in different formats          together with an archive of all previous versions.</p><p>The following 94 sources have been used to assemble the GBIF backbone with number of names given in brackets:</p><ul><li>Catalogue of Life - April 2021 - 3834939 names</li><li>International Barcode of Life project (iBOL) Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) - 564649 names</li><li>World Register of Marine Species - 378787 names</li><li>The World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) - 294141 names</li><li>The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera - 212450 names</li><li>UNITE - Unified system for the DNA based fungal species linked to the classification - 185492 names</li><li>The Paleobiology Database - 176625 names</li><li>The Plant List with literature - 140464 names</li><li>TAXREF - 121484 names</li><li>GBIF Backbone Taxonomy - 117268 names</li><li>Index Fungorum - 110358 names</li><li>Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) - 81904 names</li><li>Plazi.org taxonomic treatments database - 66789 names</li><li>International Plant Names Index - 56277 names</li><li>ZooBank - 52581 names</li><li>Fauna Europaea - 50006 names</li><li>Artsnavnebasen - 41708 names</li><li>Dyntaxa.

        "description": "This is a checklist of Amphibian Species in the Kihansi Gorge in the Udzungwa Tanzania. It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.",

Its purpose is to maintain species diversity and ecological balance. The government and related conservation organizations have designated 17 wildlife refuges. Not only are they the subject of academic researches, they are also the indicators of environmental quality. The checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists 238 endangered, rare, and other protected species of wildlife in Taiwan. The database also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information can be shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants.

Among them, 8,000 are endemic species (including endemic subspecies and varietas), showing the abundance of Taiwan\u2019s endemic Species. TaiBNET also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information on these endemic species are published and then shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information. All these efforts will result in the circulation and utilization of information in the areas of research, education and conservation.",

In the future, we hope to include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\n\nThe first phase of Catalog of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects), plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names, endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology, ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as well as deposited specimen data for each species.\n\nThrough this node, the most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each member because in such a way, education, research, and conservation of biodiversity in the world could be promoted effectively.",

Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of more than 32.000 species!\n\nThe Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS \u2013 the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences \u2013 in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.\n\nThe purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that's been described, information is given on among other things the conservation status, the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards are fitted with pictures and interesting links.\n\nThe website is aimed at a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature conversationists and all nature lovers.\n\nWant to know more? \nLog on to www.species.be!",

The introduction in 1994 of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine risks of extinction that is applicable to all species, has become a world standard. In order to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, the IUCN Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission (SSC) and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of species.",
