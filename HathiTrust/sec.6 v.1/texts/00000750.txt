;
TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pts. 17 and 38).
Styela radicosa, n.sp. (?). One specimen (120 fathoms ?); obtained also at
Station 162.
Colella murrayi, n.g., n.sp. Two specimens (120 fathoms ?); obtained at no other
locality.
;
Excluding Protozoa, about 100 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at these
Stations, belonging to 67 species, of which 62 are new to science, including represen-
tatives of 11 new genera ; 43 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The Cirripedia attached to Porocidaris and Phormosoma
belong both to the Lepadidæ, the one on the former being a true Lepas, while those on
the latter are cutaneous and probably belong to Alepas. A young specimen of Serolis
bromleyana was brought up—a remarkable fact, seeing that this species was taken in
nearly 2000 fathoms near the Ice Barrier ; Sphæroma, Galathea, and some Caridids
were also obtained.”
ORGANISMS FROM
THE DEPOSITS.
The following species of Pteropoda and Foraminifera were observed in the deposits
(see also Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.) :-
PTEROPODA (Pelseneer, Zool. pt. 65).–From 950 fathoms (Station 164).
Clio (Styliola) subula (Quoy and Gaimard).
pyramidata, Linné.
Cavolinia trispinosa (Lesueur).
FORAMINIFERA (Brady, Zool. pt. 22).—From 410 fathoms (Station 164B); the pelagic
species, which make up about 70 per cent of the carbonate of lime present in the
deposit, are marked thus x.
