THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 64.
Surface Organisms. — The following species are recorded from the surface at this
ORGANISMS FROM Station :-
SURFACE-NETS.
RADIOLARIA (Haeckel, Zool. pt. 40). BRACHYURA (Miers, Zool. pt. 49).
Acrosphæra inflata, Haeckel.
Nautilograpsus minutus (Linné).
Xiphostylus ardea, Haeckel.
Spongellipsis aplysina, Haeckel. GASTEROPODA (Watson, Zool. pt. 42).
Eucyrtidium scalarium, Haeckel.
Ianthina rotundata, Leach.
Lithocampe quadrarticulata, Haeckel. Litiopa melanostoma, Rang.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :- Tetrastemma fuscum
on Nautilograpsus, Scyllæa pelagica, Salpæ, and the surface organisms mentioned on the
17th. The absence of Phyllosoma, Zoëæ, and Stomatopod larvæ is to be noted.
Moseley writes: “Murray went out and caught a number of very fine specimens of
Ianthina, with Scyllæa pelagica and Nautilograpsus minutus living attached and simu-
lating in some instances the colour of that animal and its float, being of a slightly mottled
blue. Some Fucus (nodosus ?) of a bright yellow colour was found floating in a perfectly
living condition. This we have not met with before, but only Sargassum bacciferum.”
Willemoes-Suhm writes: “On closer examination the specimens of Nautilograpsus
were found to be covered by small brown spots, which turned out to be little parasitic
Nemerteans; these animals have not hitherto been found living as parasites. The Nemer-
tean is a small ordinary Tremacephalid, presenting no changes adduced by parasitism;
from its colour I have called it Tetrastemma fuscum, n.sp.'
