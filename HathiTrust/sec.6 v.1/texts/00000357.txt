At 1.30 P.m. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 2 P.M.

sounded in 2360 fathoms. At 4 P.M. obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 100
fathoms down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from the
surface and bottom, and amounted to 41.5 and 47.2 milligrammes per litre respectively.
At 7.30 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 1720 miles. Made good 56 miles. Amount of current
19 miles, direction N. 38° E.
Surface Organisms.—Among the surface things were Rhabdosoma, Oxycephalus, ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
and other Crustaceans.

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02709.; bottom, 1.02704.
Depth, 2575 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 31:38 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.20 A.M. shortened sail, and got up steam to sound. At 8 A.M. sounded in 2575
fathoms. At 10 A.M. put small trawl over. At 4.45 P.M. trawl came up, evidently not
having reached the bottom, probably because there was more way on the ship than was
supposed, a steady breeze blowing all the time. In the meshes of the trawl were found
a few small surface and intermediate-water fishes. Obtained a series of temperatures at
intervals of 100 fathoms down to 800 fathoms. A water-bottle was sent down attached
to the sounding-line, and water from the bottom obtained. The carbonic aci
determined in the bottom water, and amounted to 50.0 milligrammes per litre.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 1482 miles. Made good 135 miles. Amount of
current 12 miles, direction N. 33° E.
