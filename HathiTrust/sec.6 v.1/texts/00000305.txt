At 8 A.M. the surveying boats left the ship to sound out the Challenger Bank in charge
of the surveying officers, and remained out till the afternoon. The jolly-boat was sent
out three times from the ship with the dredge, which was slowly hauled into the ship by
the donkey-engine. In that way large numbers of specimens were secured. At 1.30 P.M.
surveying boats returned. At 3.45 P.M. weighed anchor, and proceeded S.S.W. under
steam. At 4 P.M. dredged in somewhat deeper water, the dredge bringing up a large
quantity of Algæ, some pebbles, stones, and specimens.
