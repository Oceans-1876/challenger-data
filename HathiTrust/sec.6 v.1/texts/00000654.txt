At 8 A.M. got up steam. At 9.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded
under steam to sound and trawl. Sounded in 1975 fathoms, and put over trawl. Obtained
series of temperatures down to 200 fathoms. Weather fine, wind moderate. At 4.30 P.M.
the trawl came up with numerous specimens,—one of the most interesting hauls made
during the cruise. At 4.40 P.M. made sail, but, the wind rising to a gale, shortened and
furled sails at 5.40 P.M., keeping during the night a position under the lee of an iceberg.
Observed slight aurora between 12 and 1 A.M. Birds as usual. Sea a greenish-blue
colour.
Distance at noon from Cape Otway, 2262 miles. Made good 87 miles. Amount of
