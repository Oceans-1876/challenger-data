At 9 A.M. sounded in 2220 fathoms, but the weights were not disengaged at the
bottom, and the line broke in hauling in, the attached water-bottle, pressure-gauge,
thermometers, and 2000 fathoms of line being lost. Took serial temperatures at intervals
of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms.
Sombrero Island distant at noon, 2428 miles. Made good 19 miles. Amount of

SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.— The following are recorded in the note-books :-Collosphæra ORGANISMS FROM
and other Radiolaria ; Velella, Physalia ; several large specimens of Alciopa ;
Copepods, Phronima sedentaria, Idothea, many larvæ of Squilla; Cardiopoda, and
small Octopus (?).
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The tow-nets captured much more in the last two nights
than during the day; at noon, and in the earlier hours of the afternoon especially, the
animals seem to retire from the heated surface as much as possible.”
Moseley writes: “Went out in a boat at mid-day; a few Radiolarians were
noticed. A pilot fish (Naucrates ductor) played all day under our bows, keeping quite
close to the cut-water, within a foot or two, swimming every now and then a little ahead
and then dropping back again. The fish is a Scomberoid, and its dark transverse
markings make it a striking object in the deep blue water as one looks down from the
bowsprit. A shark was said to have been seen about the ship.”
