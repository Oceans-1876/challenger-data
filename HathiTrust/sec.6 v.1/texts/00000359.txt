STATION 61.
HOLOTHURIOIDEA (Théel, Zool. pt. 39).
Pseudostichopus villosus, n.g., n.sp. Two specimens ; obtained also at Stations 146,
147, 156, 157, 216A, 244, 296, 302, and 325, 1375 to 2900
fathoms.
CIRRIPEDIA (Hoek, Zool. pt. 25).
Scalpellum regium, Wyville Thomson, n.sp. Six specimens; obtained also at
Station 63, 2750 fathoms.
var. ovale, nov. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
FISHES (Günther, Zool. pt. 57).
Gonostoma microdon, n.sp. Three specimens; for distribution see Station 23.
Similar specimens were frequently taken in the surface-
net.
In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book :-Two
very small siliceous Sponges, worm-tubes, and fragment of a Crustacean.
Excluding Protozoa, about 40 specimens of invertebrates and fishes were obtained
at this Station, belonging to about 7 species, of which 4 are new to science, including
representative of 1 new genus.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The Annelid-tubes contained a very tender worm, which
comes out entirely spoiled ; in order not to spoil them all I put the tubes immediately
into spirit. There was also a fragment of a shrimp, probably a Peneid or Palæmonid.
The Scalpella as well as the Holothuriæ brought up seem to indicate that the Lusitanian
deep-sea fauna extends down to these remote parts of the ocean."
Surface Organisms.—The following are recorded in the note-books :--Compound ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Radiolaria, Medusæ, Siphonophoræ, Diphyes, Gleba, Sagitta, very large specimens of
Alciopa, Cirriped larvæ, Phronima, Hyperia, Mysis, Lucifer, Atlanta, Cleodora [ = Clio),
Styliola, and Cuvierina.
