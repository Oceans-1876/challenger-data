THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 81.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—The following species are recorded from the surface at this
Station
PTEROPODA (Pelseneer, Zool. pt. 65).
Clio (Creseis) acicula (Rang).
AMPHIPODA (Stebbing, Zool. pt. 67).
Phorcorrhaphis zamboangæ, n.sp.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “In the morning some surface things were brought to me,
among which I found some Diphyes, an Amphipod of probably unknown genus, many
small Schizopods, Styliola, and many of those small bicornous Salpæ, besides the Zoëæ
and ever-present Sagitta. There was also a Salpa presenting a peculiarity in the lilac
glands of the digestive cavity ; these glands showed interruptions due either to want of
secretion, which is not very likely, or to separation into several.”
