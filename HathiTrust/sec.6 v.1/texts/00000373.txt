Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02696 ; bottom, 1.02668.
Depth, 1675 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 88:31 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. shortened sails, and got up steam to sound. At 11 A.M. sounded in 1675
fathoms. At 1 P.M. put over trawl, and obtained serial temperatures down to 1000
fathoms. Sent down slip water-bottle attached to sounding-line, and obtained sample of
water for analysis. The carbonic acid was determined in the bottom (?) water, and
amounted to 59-2 milligrammes per litre. At 7.40 P.M. trawl came up almost empty,
having fouled the line. At 8 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 284 miles. Made good 48 miles. Amount of current
16 miles, direction S. 72° E.
