THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Station 124.
haul by Professor Thomson. The similarity of the fauna here is most striking. The
actual deep-sea fauna seems to be universally distributed ; only the fauna of from
200 to 500 or 600 fathoms about the coast-lines is peculiar. Serolis, which we have
taken lately, is a South American animal living in shallow water on the coast of
Patagonia. We have here then a case of the shallow-water fauna of high latitudes
inhabiting the deep-sea of the tropics,a corresponding fact to many similar ones
observed in the northern hemisphere.”
Stations 125 TO
126a.
Stations 125 to 126A (Soundings 207 to 209), between Pernambuco and Bahia
(see Charts 12 and 15).
September 12, 1873; lat. 10° 46' S., long. 36° 2' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 78°:3 ; mean for the day, 76°.5.
Temperature of water at surface, 77°0.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1°02746; bottom, 1.02730.
Depth, 1200 fathoms; deposit, Red Mud, containing 20·79 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 A.M. sounded in 40 fathoms, no bottom. At 6 A.M. shortened
and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. Sounded in 1200 fathoms (Station 125).
At 7.30 A.M. proceeded under steam and sail. At 8.40 A.M. shortened sail, and at 9 A.M.
stopped and sounded in 770 fathoms, deposit Red Mud, containing 5.75 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (Station 126). At 10 A.M. put over trawl, which came up at 12.10 P.M.
containing various specimens. At 12.45 P.M. stopped, put trawl over, and sounded in
700 fathoms, deposit Red Mud (Station 126A). At 3.10 p.m. hove up trawl with several
specimens, and at 3.15 P.M. made all plain sail. At 4 P.m. the land was visible on the
starboard beam, but not from the deck. At 10.50 and 11.50 P.M. sounded in 45 fathoms,
no bottom.
Distance at noon from Cape San Antonio, Bahia, 197 miles. Made good 59 miles.
Amount of current 6 miles, direction N.
From the above it will be seen that the trawl was put over twice on this date, while
soundings of 770 and 700 fathoms were taken. The following species are recorded in
the Zoological Reports :-
[Polymastia corticata, Nymphaster basilicus, Aricia norvegica, var., and Synapho-
branchus pinnatus, are recorded from Station 125, 1200 fathoms, but a sounding only
was taken at that depth at 6 A.M., the trawl being put over at 10 A.M. after the ship had
steamed nearer the land at Stations 126 and 126A, 770 and 700 fathoms].
