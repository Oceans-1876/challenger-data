SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 73.
Density at 60° F. at bottom, 1.02691.
Depth, 1000 fathoms; deposit, Pteropod Ooze, containing 73.20 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and dredge.
Sounded in 1000 fathoms, and put dredge over. At 11 A.M. dredge came up with a large
quantity of ooze, and many specimens. Dredge put over again. At 1.30 P.M. obtained
serial temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to the bottom. At 4 P.M. dredge
came up reversed, but the tangles contained a number of specimens similar to those of
the previous haul. The carbonic acid was determined in the bottom (?) water, and
amounted to 44.6 milligrammes per litre. At 4.20 P.m. proceeded under steam.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 114 miles. Made good 44 miles. Amount of current
8 miles, direction S. 34° W. The island of Flores was faintly visible during the day.
