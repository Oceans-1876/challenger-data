Depth, 2600 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing 18:56 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.10 A.M. shortened and furled sails, put over trawl, and veered 2500 fathoms.
At 8 A.m. brought ship to wind, and proceeded under steam to sound. Sounded in
2600 fathoms ; veered trawl-rope to 3450 fathoms. About half a litre of Red Clay came
up in the sounding-tube. At noon obtained temperatures down to 1000 fathoms. The
carbonic acid was determined in the bottom water, and amounted to 53.7 milligrammes per
litre. At 2.30 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 5.30 P.M. with the
net much torn, but containing numerous specimens, a quantity of Red Clay, with many
manganese nodules, ear-bones of Cetaceans, and sharks' teeth. To the nodules were attached
Cirripeds, Antipathes, Terebratula, and Tunicata. Observed albatrosses, molly mawks,
night hawks, and mutton birds. At 6 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Cape Otway, 488 miles. Made good 149 miles. Amount of
current 13 miles, direction N. 57° E.
