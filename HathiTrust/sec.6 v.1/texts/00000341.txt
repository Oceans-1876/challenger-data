Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02711.
Depth, 2500 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 54.81 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6 A.M. stopped and lowered jolly-boat to pick up piece of timber, which was found
to be covered with Lepas, among which were running about many Brachyurous crabs ;
there were also several Annelids. At 8.50 A.M. stopped to sound, and at 9 A.M. sounded
in 2500 fathoms (Station 55). Lowered boats to try current; ascertained that a surface
current was running N.E. at the rate of 4 miles per
hour. Obtained serial temperatures
at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1000 fathoms. At 1 P.m. proceeded under steam,
and towards evening sighted the light on Gibb's Hill, Bermuda. At 6 P. M. stopped and
sounded in 1775 fathoms, deposit Globigerina Ooze, bottom temperature 36°:2 (Station
55A).
Distance at noon from Bermuda, 66 miles. Made good 97 miles. Amount of current
8 miles, direction N. 54° W.
