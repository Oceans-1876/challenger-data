Depth, 1950 fathoms ; deposit, Diatom Ooze, containing 19:29 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails and proceeded under steam to trawl and
sound. At 8 A.M. put over trawl, and at 9 A.M. sounded in 1950 fathoms. A small
quantity of Diatom Ooze came up on the sounding tube. Several temperatures
were taken down to 500 fathoms. Samples of water were taken from depths of
50 and 100 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in the bottom water, and
amounted to 44:3 milligrammes per litre. The tow-nets, which were dragged at the
surface of the sea and a few fathoms beneath, came up nearly filled with a slimy
mass consisting almost entirely of Diatoms; besides the Diatoms there were many
pelagic Foraminifera, Radiolarians, a few Copepods, Cypridinidæ, Hyperidæ, and
Pteropods. At 2 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 4 P.M. with a
large quantity of Diatom Ooze, many large and small stones, and numerous animals.
This was one of the most successful hauls of the expedition. A few of the usual sea-
birds were observed during the day. The wind fell to a calm during the afternoon.
There was a brilliant sunset, and at 11.45 P.M. a fine aurora australis, stretching in four
concentric arcs over the S.E. to W. horizon.
Distance at noon from Cape Otway, 1721 miles. Made good 137 miles. Amount of
current for the past three days 55 miles, direction N. 19° E.
