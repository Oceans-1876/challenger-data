THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 49.
Willemoes-Suhm writes: “Among great numbers of Crustacea, worms, &c., obtained
in the dredge, some Squillids were remarkable for their Bopyri, and some specimens of
Anthura were procured. Nymphon was in great abundance, and the various stages in
its development could be followed; the larvæ just hatched had only three pairs of legs,
the fourth being represented by two rudiments merely at each side of the tail.” may
mention that I found the Dentalia inhabited by Sipunculi quite in the same way as
they are on the Danish coasts.
