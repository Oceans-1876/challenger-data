Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02502 ; bottom, 1.02574.
Depth, 1050 fathoms ; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 22:11 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At daylight observed the west coast of Luzon on starboard beam. Got up steam.
At 7 A.M. proceeded under steam. At 9.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and sounded
in 1050 fathoms. At 10 A.M. put trawl over. Weather fine, but a heavy swell from the
N.E. Obtained serial temperatures down to the bottom. At 4 P.M. trawl came up with
several pieces of pumice, some pieces of wood and leaves, and many specimens. At
4.45 P.M. made all plain sail. About sunset got into the N.E. monsoon in earnest,
accompanied by a rise of the barometer and a fall of the thermometer; velocity of
wind 5. At 11.15 P.m. maintop-gallant sheet carried away. Night stormy and wet
with high sea.
Distance at noon from Pratas Island, 287 miles ; from N.E. head of Lema Island,
near Hong Kong, 432 miles. Made good 99 miles. Amount of current 22 miles,
direction N. 25° W.
