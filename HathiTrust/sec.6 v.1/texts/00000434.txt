THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 97.
Moseley writes : “At night the sea showed wonderful phosphorescence, being lighted
up
for miles around. Wherever the water broke a little on the surface, the white foam
was brilliantly lighted up, and the water close to the ship, as viewed from above on the
bridge, was full of small luminous points. As the water broke at the ship’s side the lower
studding sails were quite lighted up by the glow. The whole sea had a peculiar weird
look. The water was found to be full of small Crustacea, larval crabs in the megalopus-
stage being present in by far the greatest abundance, and the light must evidently be
considered as due to them in part, but mostly to Pyrocystis [at first thought to be fish
spawn, afterwards looked upon as an encysted form of Noctiluca], the specimens of which
were of various sizes and showed phosphorescence when first caught and placed in a globe of
water. The spectroscope used on the light under the stern allowed a very small portion
of red, all the yellow, and a certain amount of green, to be seen, but the light was not
strong enough to allow of exact determination.”

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02605; bottom, 1.02605.
Depth, 1750 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 62-22 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 10 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. Sounded in
1750 fathoms, havirg approached the west coast of Africa, in order to make a haul with
the dredge in shallower water. Took serial temperatures down to 500 fathoms. At
12.15 P.M. put over dredge, and veered 2500 fathoms. At 4 P.M. commenced heaving in
the dredge, which came up at 5.15 P.M. containing a few specimens. At 5.40 P.M. made
sail. In the evening there was a similar display of phosphorescence as on previous days.
Distance at noon in direct line from St. Paul's Rocks, 825 miles.
Made good
136 miles. Amount of current 13 miles, direction S. 32° E.
