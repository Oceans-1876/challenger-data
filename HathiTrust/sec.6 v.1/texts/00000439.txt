Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02635.
Depth, 2500 fathoms; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 6-22 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to trawl.
At 7 A.M.
put trawl over. At 9 A.M. sounded in 2500 fathoms. At 1.30 P.M. lowered cutter to
ascertain surface current. Obtained serial temperatures down to 800 fathoms. The
carbonic acid was determined in the surface water, and amounted to 45.5 milligrammes
At 3.30 P.M. cutter returned. At 4 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which
came up at 5 P.M. with a number of specimens. At 5.10 P.m. proceeded as requisite,
obtaining error of Fox dipping-needle. At 7 P.M. proceeded under steam,
St. Paul's Rocks distant at noon, 952 miles. Made good 99 miles. Amount of
current 33 miles, direction N. 44º E.
