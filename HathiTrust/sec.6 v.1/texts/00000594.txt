THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 146.
Antimora rostrata, n.g., n.sp. One specimen ; obtained also at Station 320,
600 fathoms.
Macrurus filicauda, n.sp. Twelve specimens ; obtained also at Stations 157, 158,
299, 323, and 325, 1800 to 2650 fathoms.
armatus, Hector. Six specimens ; obtained also at Stations 147, 157,
158, 246, and 271, 1600 to 2425 fathoms. Recorded
from New Zealand.
Halosaurus macrochir,' n.sp. Four specimens ; obtained also at Station V.
Synaphobranchus bathybius, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained also at Stations 237
and 246, 1875 and 2050 fathoms.
In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book :-
Euplectella and several other Sponges (only two species reported), a few Hydroids,
several Comatulæ, Stylifer on Echini, Nudibranch, and several species of Polyzoa.
Excluding Protozoa, about 200 specimens of invertebrates and fishes were obtained
at this Station, belonging to about 78 species, of which 66 are new to science,
including representatives of 17 new genera; 15 of the new species were not
obtained elsewhere, while other 9 new species were taken also only at the neighbouring
Station 147.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The trawl brought up a rich harvest. On the whole it
is important that the fauna in this southern latitude of the Indian Ocean has been found
to be essentially the same as in the deep water of the tropics. The great apparent
frequency and size of the Pycnogonids is new, for they have hitherto been taken only
three times in deep water, and then only small specimens. Of the other animals at least
ten have been obtained in the tropical deep sea, especially on the coast of Brazil, viz.,
Euplectella, Umbellula, the soft Holothurian, Brisinga, Serolis, Chalaraspis [=Eucopia],
and four of the fishes. The large Arcturus and gigantic Amphipod remind one very
much of the features said to be peculiar to deep-sea (or even shallow-water) forms
of the north. One of the fishes, the whitish eel-like animal [= Synaphobranchus
bathybius), had in its stomach several specimens of the little Echinolampas [= Urechinus
naresianus), which came up in such quantities, evidently proving that it had fed
the bottom.”
ORGANISMS FROM
THE DEPOSIT.
FORAMINIFERA (Brady, Zool. pt. 22).—The following species of Foraminifera were
observed in the deposit from this Station (see also Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea
Deposits Chall. Exp.); the pelagic species, which make up about 87 per cent of the
carbonate of lime present in the deposit, are marked thus * :--
1 On the specimen of this species from Station V., 1090 fathoms, a new species of Distomum (Distomum
halosauri, n.sp.) has been found (see F. J. Bell, Ann, and Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, vol. xix. pp. 116–17, 1887).
