THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATIONS 149 TO
149K.
(KERGUELEN).
Stations 149 to 149K (Soundings 243 to 253), off Kerguelen Island (see
Chart 21).
January 9 to 29, 1874.
Depth, 20 to 150 fathoms; deposit, Green Muds, containing about 1 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
From January 9 to 29, 1874, a great many soundings, dredgings, and trawlings
were taken off the coast of Kerguelen, in depths varying between 20 and 150 fathoms
(Stations 149 to 149K). For description of Kerguelen see Narr. Chall. Exp., vol. i.
pp. 332–361. The dredgings and trawlings were very successful, and as it would be
almost impossible to give a list of the species from each Station, they are all combined,
the depth given in the Reports being indicated :-
