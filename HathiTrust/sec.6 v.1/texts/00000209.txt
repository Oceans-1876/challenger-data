adapted for swimming ; Ianthina, with air-bladder; Firoloida ; Salpa and Appendicu-
laria. Among the large quantity of animals examined, no larvæ of worms nor of
Echinoderms, nor Cyphonautes were found.
The Challenger remained at anchor at Gibraltar from 8 A.M. on January 18 till AT GIBRALTAR.

Surface Organisms. --Willemoes-Suhm writes : “Near Gibraltar, on January 26, a
specimen of Orthagoriscus mola was seen at the surface. Among the surface things taken SURFACE-NETS.
on January 27, I find the first swimming worm, a Syllis, remarkable for long prolonga-
tions of the feet; the animal examined is not, however, full-grown. Among the Cope-
pods I find Copilia denticulata, Claus [ = Copilia mirabilis, Dana], a remarkable
Saphirinoid, in which the red-coloured eyes are at a great distance from the cornea in
the front; the anterior part of the body shows exceedingly well the nervous system, the
otolith, and the innervation of the glands described by Haeckel in Saphirina edwardsii.
There were also many specimens of Beroë, Cydippe, Sagitta, megalopa stage of crab,
Carinaria, Pteropods, Appendicularia, Salpa, and Doliolum. Worm larvæ, Echino-
derm larvæ, and Cyphonautes observed for the first time abundantly to-day.”
