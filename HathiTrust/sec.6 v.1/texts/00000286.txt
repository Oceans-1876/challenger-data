THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 25.
1.30 P.M. commenced heaving in the dredge. The toggle came up with only one weight,
and at 5 P.M. the dredge came up with a considerable quantity of Red Clay. In the
course of the afternoon temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms
were obtained. The carbonic acid was determined in the bottom water, and amounted
to 57.0 milligrammes per litre. At 7.30 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance from Bermuda at noon, 754 miles. Made good 58 miles. Amount of
current 14 miles, direction N. 37° W.
STATION 26.
Station 26 (Sounding 73), St. Thomas to Bermuda (see Chart 6 and Diagram 2).
March 27, 1873; lat. 21° 26' N., long. 65° 16' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 73°:8; mean for the day, 75°•0.
Temperature of water at surface, 76°:0.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02704; bottom, 1•02594.
Depth, 2800 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing 6.00 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
snow.
At 1.15 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 2.30 P.M.
sounded in 2800 fathoms. The thermometer at the bottom registered several degrees
below the freezing point, but it was believed to be faulty. Buchanan sent down some
small glass hermetically-sealed tubes enclosed in a copper cylinder open at both ends.
The glass in the case of one of the tubes was shattered into the finest powder, like
The copper cylinder was compressed and crumpled together opposite the spot
where the tube had been. The inference was that, the glass tube giving way very
suddenly and leaving a comparative vacuum, there was not sufficient time for the
production of equilibrium by the transmission of water through the ends of the
cylinder, but this was partly brought about by the more direct action of the pressure,
the cylinder wall being driven in. The experiment was, indeed, a kind of reversal of
the explosion of gases or gunpowder. Obtained sample of bottom water. The carbonic
acid was determined in the surface water, and amounted to 460 milligrammes per
litre. Jolly-boat away collecting surface specimens. At 5.10 P.M. completed heaving
in sounding line.
Distance from Bermuda at noon, 654 miles. Made good 100 miles. Amount of
current 14 miles, direction N. 55º W.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.-Murray was away in jolly-boat picking up Crustacea, Anten-
narius, pipe-fish, &c., from numerous patches of gulf-weed.
