At 9.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam in three boilers. At
10.10 A.M. proceeded under steam. At 4.5 P.M. stopped to obtain a series of tempera-
tures and specimens of water. At 5.40 P.M. made sail. After nightfall there was a
magnificent display of phosphorescence, principally in the wake of the Challenger, caused
by the presence of innumerable specimens of Pyrosoma, several of which were caught in
a net, and when brought on deck continued to display a bright bluish light when touched
by the fingers.
Distance at noon from St. Paul's Rocks, 801 miles. Made good 92 miles. Amount of

ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—Moseley writes : “ At night the sea was full of specimens of
Pyrosoma about 4 to 5 inches long. These are the cause of the large spots of
persistent bluish light which I have so often watched going by the ship, and which
contrast so strikingly with the momentary scintillations of the minute Crustacea, or
