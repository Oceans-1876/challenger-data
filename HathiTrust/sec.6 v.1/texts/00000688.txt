THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 160.
OSTRACODA (Brady, Zool. pt. 3).
Cytheropteron abyssorum, n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
CIRRIPEDIA (Hoek, Zool. pt. 25).
Scalpellum planum, n.sp. One specimen; obtained at no other locality.
SCAPHOPODA (Watson, Zool. pt. 42).
Dentalium leptoskeles, n.sp. Several specimens ; obtained also at Station 157.
Polyzoa (Busk, Zool. pt. 30).
Cellepora solida, n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
BRACHIOPODA (Davidson, Zool. pt. 1).
Terebratula wyvillii, n.sp. Several specimens; obtained also at Stations 184, 244,
299, 302, and 317, 1035 to 2900 fathoms.
TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pts. 17 and 76).
Styela bythia, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
squamosa, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
Abyssascidia wyvillii, n.g., n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
The only other species of the genus (Abyssascidia vasculosa)
was taken at Station 157.
Pyrosoma sp. (?) (giganteum ?). One specimen and fragments (dead and decayed).
In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book :-Small
Umbellula, fragments of Pourtalesia, and a broken Lamellibranch.
Excluding Protozoa, about 50 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at this
Station, belonging to about 30 species, of which 25 are new to science, including
representatives of 10 new genera; 16 of the new species and 2 new genera were not
obtained elsewhere.
Moseley writes : “Numerous Antipathariæ were attached to the manganese nodules,
thus showing that they do not lie deeply embedded in the mud.”
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “In to-day's deep-sea trawling there was one small
Aphroditacean, and no Crustacea except a Scalpellum. If the red Peneids lived in
intermediate waters we should surely have taken some to-day. The genera represented :
Umbellula, Antipathes, Ophioglypha, Brisinga, Scalpellum, and Dentalium (perhaps also
the species), are those got all through the cruise in deep water.”
