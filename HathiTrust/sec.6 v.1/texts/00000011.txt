EDITORIAL NOTES.
The Challenger Expedition was organised by the British Government during
the years 1871 and 1872 at the suggestion of the Royal Society. The ship
was fitted out under the direction of Admiral G. H. Richards, at that time
Hydrographer of the Admiralty, and she sailed from Sheerness in December
1872.
The special object of the Expedition was the scientific exploration of
the physical, chemical, geological, and biological conditions of the great
ocean basins. In addition to a full complement of specially selected Naval
Officers, the Expedition comprised a scientific staff of six civilians, under
the direction of Professor C. Wyville Thomson.
After circumnavigating the globe, and carrying on deep-sea and other
investigations in many regions of the ocean, the Challenger returned to
England in May 1876, and the crew was paid off after the ship had been
in commission for over three years and seven months.
Numerous scientific observations were successfully recorded in all branches
of oceanic research. Large zoological and other collections were sent home
from various ports during the voyage, and were brought home in the ship.
Soon after the return of the Expedition considerable correspondence took
place between the authorities at the Admiralty, the Treasury, the British
Museum, and the Royal Society, with reference to the disposal of the collec-
tions, the best way of discussing the observations and the method of publishing
the scientific results of the Expedition. It was ultimately decided that the
land and other incidental collections made by members of the Expedition
during the voyage should be at once handed over to the British Museum
for incorporation in the national collections. It was further determined that
the records of the various observations and the marine collections should
remain in the meantime in the hands of those who had taken part in the
