THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 133.
Moseley remarks : “We have found nearly all the forms also in the North Atlantic;
the universal distribution of deep-sea forms becomes more and more apparent.”
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms. — The tow-net sent down to a depth of about 100 fathoms brought
up:-Foraminifera, Radiolaria, Sagitta, Tomopteris, a great many Copepods, Hyperia,
Oxycephalus, Vibilia, Cleodora [= Clio), developmental stages of Pyrosoma, and
Appendicularia, while the tow-net attached to the dredge-line brought up many surface
animals, including Medusæ, some Amphipods, and a naked Pteropod, the Amphipods
being more abundant than at the surface. Many of the Globigerinæ and Pulvinulinæ
were surrounded with a mass of yellow sarcode in which were entangled many
Coccospheres, Rhabdospheres, Infusoria (Tintinnus), and Diatoms. These minute
organisms were also observed in the stomachs of the Tunicates. The Foraminifera were
different from those found near the equator on the trip from Cape Verdes to Bahia, the
shells being less massive and Sphæroidina and Pullenia did not appear to be present in
the surface gatherings.

Depth, 2025 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 59:18 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3 A.M. got up steam. At 4.30 A.m. shortened and furled sails. At 5.30 A.M.
observed Tristan da Cunha with its snow-covered summit to the S.S. W. At 7 A.M.
stopped and sounded in 2025 fathoms.
At 9 A.M. put dredge over. Obtained a
series of temperatures. At 1.15 P.m. commenced heaving in dredge, which came up
at 3 P.M. with a few specimens. Proceeded under steam. At 4 P.M. altered course as
requisite to swing ship. At 6 P.M. completed swinging ship. At sunset Tristan da
Cunha ahead. Director of Scientific Staff arranging exploring parties for examining
the island on the morrow. At 10.15 P.M. stopped and lay to for the night, the island
of Tristan da Cunha to the S.W. The weather became sensibly colder, necessitating
change of clothing.
