In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book :-Several
specimens of Eupsammia, Annelid, small Cirriped, Pagurus in shells, two large specimens
of Lupea and other Brachyura (one only noted above).
Excluding Protozoa, about 100 specimens of invertebrates and fishes were obtained
at this Station, belonging to about 60 species, of which 10 are new to science, including
representative of 1 new genus ; 9 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
Surface Organisms.- The following are recorded in the note-books from the tow-nets OrganisMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
on October 31 and November 1 :-Diatoms in immense numbers, Vorticella abundant
on some of the Diatoms, Pyrocystis, Peridinium (Ceratium) tripos and another species,
Radiolaria, larvæ of Cirripeds. The sarcode matter of most of the Diatoms had quite
the same appearance as in Pyrocystis.

November 2, 1874.
Temperature of air at noon, 82°:3; mean for the day, 82º.2.
Temperature of water at surface, 84°:0.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02517.
At 5.30 A.M. got up steam. At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded
under steam. At 10 A.M. stopped and sounded in 705 fathoms, deposit Blue Mud,
containing 11:31 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 204). In this deposit were
numerous pellets, believed to be the dung of Holothurians and other Echinoderms, as well
as minute stellate bodies, supposed to be Holothurian spicules. Proceeded through the
channel between Tablas and Romblon Islands. At 2.30 P.M. stopped and sounded in
100 fathoms, deposit Green Mud, containing 56:18 per cent. of carbonate of lime,
density at bottom 1:02569 (Station 204a). Put over trawl, which came up at 3 P.M.
with numerous specimens. At 3.45 P.M. stopped and sounded in 115 fathoms, deposit
Green Mud, containing 50:40 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 204B).
