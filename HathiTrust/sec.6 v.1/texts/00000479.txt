Stations 122
to 122c.
Stations 122 to 122c (Soundings 201 to 204), between Pernambuco and Bahia
(see Chart 15).
September 10, 1873; lat. 9° 5' S., lony. 34° 50' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 79°:0; mean for the day, 76°:5.
Temperature of water at surface, 77°•5.
At 4.15 A.M. stopped and sounded in 350 fathoms, deposit Red Mud, containing
42:15
per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 122). At daylight, observed land to N.W.
At 6 A.M. stopped, and at 6.15 A.M. lowered trawl, which came up at 8 A.M. with
numerous specimens. The dredge had been sent down at the same time as the trawl,
and it also brought up several specimens. Put over trawl, after emptying it of
its contents. At 9.30 A.M. sounded in 120 fathoms, deposit Red Mud, containing
49·10 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 122A). Hove up trawl containing several
specimens. At 10 A.m. sounded in 32 fathoms, deposit Red Sandy Mud with shells
(Station 122B). At 11.45 A.M. stopped and sounded in 400 fathoms, deposit Red Mud
(Station 122c). Put over trawl, which came up at 1.40 P.M. with several specimens.
At 2 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Cape San Antonio, Bahia, 318 miles. Made good 42 miles.
Amount of current 17 miles, direction N. 36° W.
From the above it will be seen that on September 10, 1873, off the coast of Brazil,
the trawl was sent down three times and the dredge once, while soundings of 350, 120,
32, and 400 fathoms were recorded (Stations 122, 1221, 122B, 122c). It is almost
impossible to state exactly the depth from which the specimens were obtained, so in the
following list of species recorded in the Zoological Reports the various stations are
combined, the depth given being indicated :-
ANIMALS FROM
DREDGE AND
KERATOSA (Poléjaeff, Zool. pt. 31).
Cacospongia levis, n.sp. One specimen (400 fathoms); obtained at no other locality. TRAWL.
Stelospongos longispinus (Fonbressin and Michelotti). One specimen (400 fathoms);
obtained at no other locality by the Challenger.
Verongia tenuissima, Hyatt (?). One specimen (400 fathoms); obtained at no other
locality by the Challenger.
