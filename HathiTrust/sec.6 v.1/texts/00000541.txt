SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 138.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02631 ; bottom, 1.02580.
Depth, 2650 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing 26.22 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 7.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 8 A.M.
proceeded under steam, and at 9 A.m. sounded in 2650 fathoms. Obtained serial
temperatures at intervals of 50 fathoms down to 500 fathoms. At 11.30 A. M. completed
temperature observations, and at 11.45 A.M. made all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Cape of Good Hope, 519 miles. Made good 135 miles.
Amount of current 10 miles, direction $. 38° E.
DIATOMACEÆ.—The following species of Diatoms were observed by Mr. Comber ORGANISMS FROM
THE DEPOSIT.
in the deposit from this Station (see also Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall.
Exp.) :-
Nitzschia marina, Grunow.
Coscinodiscus lineatus, Ehrenberg.
lentiginosus, Janisch.
atlanticus, Castracane.
curvatulus, Grunow.
Coscinodiscus centralis, Ehrenberg, var.
elegans, Greville.
Hemidiscus cuneiformis, Wallich.
Actinoptychus splendens, Ralfs.
The siliceous organisms in this deposit do not make up more than one or two
per cent. of this Red Clay, and more than half the Diatoms belong to Coscinodiscus
lentiginosus, a species common in the Antarctic Diatom Ooze.
