Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02739; bottom, 1.02602.
Depth, 1945 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 64.55 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.15 A.M. put over dredge, veering 2700 fathoms. At 7 A.M. sounded in 1945
fathoms. At 8 A.M. the barge went away to obtain a series of temperatures at
various depths, and returned at 1.30 P.M. At 1.30 P.M. commenced heaving in
dredge, which came up at 3.30 P.M. half full of Globigerina Ooze.
Position at noon, about 260 miles west of Cape Bojador; Sombrero Island distant
2482 miles. Made good 95 miles. Amount of current 10 miles, direction S. 11° W.
ANIMALS FROM
DREDGE.
The following species is recorded from the dredge at this Station :-
CEPHALOPODA (Hoyle, Zool. pt. 44).
Mastigoteuthis agassizii, Verrill. Fragments of tentacles ; obtained at no other
locality by the Challenger. Recorded from North Carolina.
In addition to the above Cephalopod fragment, the dredge contained a mutilated
specimen of a worm belonging to the Gephyrea, thus described by Willemoes-Suhm :
“ The animal shows characters of both the Sipunculacea and the Priapulacea : it has no
tentacles (Priapulacea); the anus is near the mouth in the anterior part of the body
(Sipunculacea); and it has no proboscis (Priapulacea). The pharynx is very short, and
is attached to the walls of the body by four retractores. The pharynx shows six or seven
folds, being composed of prominences covered by ‘Pflasterepithel,' and at their ends by
a chitinous border. At the entrance of the mouth these papillæ with chitinous borders
are more pointed and stronger; in each are seen some unicellular glands, granular bodies
showing a nucleus and a nucleolus. Owing to the state of the specimen, nothing can be
said about the rest of the body.”
ORGANISMS FROM
THE DEPOSIT.
FORAMINIFERA (Brady, Zool. pt. 22).—The ooze was carefully sifted, and was found to
contain many otoliths of fishes and Pteropod shells (see also Murray and Renard, Deep-
Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.). The following species of Foraminifera were also observed
-
