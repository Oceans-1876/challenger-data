In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books from the surface and down
to a depth of 50 fathoms (March 15 and 16):-Cuboides, Diphyes, Physalia, Sagitta,
Alciopa, Cypridina, small species of Saphirina of a beautiful blue colour, Hyalophyllum
[= Saphirinella], other small Copepods, Hyperia, larvæ of Euphausia and higher
Decapoda, Styliola, Cleodora [= Clio), Atlanta, small fishes of two or three species,
and the body of a Cimicid Hemipter (not Cimex lectularia). Physalia, Saphirina, and
Saphirinella, were observed for the first time after leaving the Cape.
Willemoes-Suhm writes: “Besides Sergestes, which after Phronima was one of the
first warm-water animals met with, there was also the Saphirinid Hyalophyllum
pellucidum [= Saphirinella stylifera), a species found in the Atlantic. Styliola and
Atlanta became more abundant. The presence of a Hemipterous insect on the
surface indicated the neighbourhood of land, and many large Medusa .were floating past
the ship. A small species of Saphirina of a metallic dark blue colour (a species not
observed in the Atlantic) was very common.”
The expedition remained at Melbourne from 2 P.M. on March 17 till 6 A.M. on
April 1, 1874, refitting the ship and obtaining magnetic and other observations on shore.
