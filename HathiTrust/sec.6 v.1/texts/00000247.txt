seems to me to be Corycæus ( = Corycæus pellucidus, Dana (see Brady, Zool. pt. 23, pp.
112-114)], the differences between it and the described species being very peculiar ones,
but not important enough to justify a generic separation. The peculiarities consist in a
'processus pectoralis,' receiving the two long pigmented bodies which form parts of the
eyes of these Crustaceans, and in the post-abdomen of the female, which has rather an
inflated and peculiar form. The male differs from the female, as usual, in having a larger
second pair of antennæ, the legs larger and broader, the spine at the end of the abdomen
less prominent, and the post-abdomen with larger caudal appendages on the 'furca.'
The males are of a greyish colour, while the females, which in our specimens were just
bearing empty spermatophores, were of a beautiful blue colour, due for the most part
to the vitelli of the eggs in the ovary. They were not remarked in great numbers.”

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02767 ; bottom, 1.02621.
Depth, 2575 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 51•16 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 7 A.M.
sounded in 2575 fathoms. The stop-cock water-bottle was attached 500 fathoms from
the Hydra. At 9.55 A.m. the small dredge was sent down with 3000 fathoms of rope,
1 cwt. being attached 300 fathoms in front of the dredge, and later in the day an
additional } cwt. was slipped down the line. At 11.45 A.M. the current-drag was sent
down to a depth of 500 fathoms, and appeared to indicate a considerable surface
current, but the drag was lost, probably owing to a slight leak in the current-buoy.
Serial temperatures were taken at intervals of 20 fathoms down to 200 fathoms, and
samples of water from depths of 500 and 1000 fathoms. At 3 P.M. commenced heaving in
dredge, which came up at 5.20 P.M. bottom upwards and quite empty. The upsetting of
the dredge was probably owing to the twist in the new rope, as the double chain, to
which the dredge was immediately attached, was twisted into a close spiral.
