not hitherto obtained, probably because it does not live on the surface but in the sea-
weeds of shallow-water regions. Phylliroë was also present, but I am not sure whether
it is identical with Phylliroë bucephala, which is well known from the North Atlantic
and Mediterranean, and which is usually accompanied by a small jelly-fish (Discophore)
attached to its ventral surface (described by Krohn under the name of Mnestra parasitica),
or whether it belongs to the species upon which Adams founded his genus Acura. Our
species was taken only to the south of the Cape Verdes, and, as it is quite transparent,
is very useful for the study of the anatomy of the Nudibranchs. In the skin are many
glands and silvery spots, which have proved to be chromatophores; the short intestine,
terminated on the right side by an anus, is connected with four large lobes of liver, and
there are also visible the generative organs (especially the two hermaphroditical glands,
the seminal and ovarial gland with the penis, all running into a genital atriunı), the heart
with its atrium situated behind the ventricle, and the excretory organ (an elongated
simple tube opening on the right side). There are no organs of locomotion, and branchiæ
are entirely absent, so that the respiration must be cutaneous. In swimming on the
surface the animal slightly moves the posterior and flattened part of its body when
gliding along."
