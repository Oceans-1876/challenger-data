AND 173A.
by jerks, the propelling spouts from the siphon being directed somewhat downwards, so
that the shell was a little rotated and raised to a slightly greater extent out of the water
at each jerk. Occasionally when the animal was excited it made a sort of dash, the water
being spouted out with great violence, so as to cause a strong eddy on the surface. On
each side of the base of the opercular-like head-fold, the fold of the mantle closing the
gill-cavity was to be seen rising and falling with a pulsating motion, which was very
conspicuous. The tentacular-like arms were held extended radially from the head, like
the tentacles of an Actinian somewhat, but each pair in a constant and different direction.
One pair was held directly downwards; those on each side of the eye were held projecting
obliquely from it forwards and backwards, as if to protect that organ. The smallness
and fineness of the arms were very striking, as also the very definite direction of each
pair.”
The specimen of Chaunax was of a beautiful rose colour, and the tentacular-like
appendages along the body appeared to mimic closely the red Algæ. All the scales had
been rubbed off the Scopelid when hauling in the trawl.

At daylight observed Kandavu Island on the starboard beam. At 7.45 A.M. stopped
off the entrance to Ngaloa Harbour, and despatched surveying boats. Soundings were
taken :-in 140 fathoms, deposit Coral Mud, containing 86:41 per cent. of carbonate of
lime (Station 174); in 160 fathoms, deposit Coral Mud (Station 174A); in 255 fathoms,
deposit Coral Mud, containing 86:31 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 174B); in
610 fathoms, deposit Globigerina Ooze, containing 79:65 per cent. of carbonate of lime
(Station 174c); and in 210 fathoms, deposit Coral Mud, containing 86.97 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (Station 174D). At the last three Stations trawlings and dredgings
were taken, the trawl being used in 255 and 610 fathoms, and the dredge in 210 fathoms.
