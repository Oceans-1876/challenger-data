SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 53.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02708 ; bottom, 1.02700.
Depth, 2650 fathoms ; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 3188 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.45 A.M. stopped to sound and obtain temperatures. At 7 A.M. sounded in
2650 fathoms. At 9 A.M., after commencing temperature operations, the line, with seven
thermometers attached, carried away, having fouled the propeller. Continued taking
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in
bottom water, and amounted to 64.0 milligrammes per litre; the water was slightly
turbid with calciuni carbonate. The wind fell to a calm, and the ship proceeded under
steam.
Distance from Bermuda at noon, 261 miles. Made good 69 miles. Amount of
current 8 miles, direction N. 61° E.
Surface Organisms. — The following species is recorded from the surface at this ORGANISMS FROM
Station :
SURFACE-Nets.
PTEROPODA (Pelseneer, Zool. pt. 65).
Clio pyramidata, Linné.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ Among the surface things there was a Pteropod distin-
guished by two pairs of lateral appendages, one pair bearing thread cells. It was, as the
ovary showed, a full-grown animal. It has been figured by Eschscholtz; Rang reproduces
the figure, adding that he does not believe it to be a good species, but that Eschscholtz
was deceived by some foreign bodies hanging out of the shell of a Cleodora [=Clio]
cuspidata, among the synonyms of which he therefore places it. Our figure shows
that Cleodora pleuropus, Rang, is a perfectly distinct and 'good' species. There was also a
young, very transparent, Sipunculus, which shows that these worms, after having quitted
the larval stage, continue to swim at the surface for a certain time, probably by the aid of
their tentacles. There were, besides, shrimps belonging to Euphausia and Thysanopoda,
and many specimens of Lucifer, of which I never could hitherto find the female ; males
with ripening spermatophores were, however, frequently observed.”
