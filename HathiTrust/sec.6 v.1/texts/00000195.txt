A. ATLANTIC OCEAN (outward voyage).
The fitting out of the Challenger for the special work in which she was to be
engaged commenced in June 1872, and the ship was commissioned on 15th November.
When the provisions and stores had been received on board, the ship was carefully
swung to ascertain the errors of the magnetic instruments. She sailed from Sheerness
on 7th December, arriving at Portsmouth on the 11th, after a stormy passage, one of
the quarter boats being lost in a gale.
The Challenger left Portsmouth on the 21st December 1872, and in her passage
across the Bay of Biscay experienced heavy weather. On the 29th December the tow-
nets were dragged in the surface water, and specimens of Acanthometra, Collosphæra,
Medusæ, Crustacea, Carinaria, and Salpa were captured. On the 30th December the
first attempts were made at sounding and dredging, the object being chiefly to exercise
the seamen in the use of the apparatus.
