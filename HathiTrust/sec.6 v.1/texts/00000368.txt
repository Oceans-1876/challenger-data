THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 69.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02712.
Depth, 2200 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze.
At 9.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and trawl. At 10
A.M. put trawl over, and at 12.30 P.M. sounded in 2200 fathoms. A water-bottle was
. sent down attached to the sounding-line, but it came up empty, the line having fouled
the slip-valve. At 2 P.m. obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down
to 1500 fathoms. At 5.30 P.m. trawl came up, containing a large red Schizopod and
Pyrosoma. At 5.50 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 404 miles. Made good 95 miles. Amount of current
27 miles, direction N. 19° W.
ANIMALS FROM
TRAWL.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the trawl at this
Station :
SCHIZOPODA (Sars, Zool. pt. 37).
Gnathophausia gigas, Willemoes-Suhm, n.g., n.sp. One specimen; part of the
moulted skin of another specimen was obtained at Station
157, 1950 fathoms.
TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pt. 76).
Pyrosoma spinosum, n.sp. Gigantic specimen, of which only pieces were preserved
(may have been caught near the surface). Obtained also
at Station 133, 1900 fathoms.
The above Pyrosoma was 4 feet 2 inches in length and 9 inches in diameter: a
wonderfully perfect and beautiful specimen dotted all over with red dots, each dot being
the visceral nucleus of an individual. It showed phosphorescence at night when irritated,
and one could write one's name on it with the finger. It all broke up into separate
animals before morning. In each individual was an ovum not yet sufficiently developed
to show the quadripartite embryo. The trawl evidently did not reach the bottom.

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02708.

carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
