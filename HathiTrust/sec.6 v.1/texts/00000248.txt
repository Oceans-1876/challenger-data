THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 11.
Distance from Sombrero Island at noon, 1307 miles. Made good 109 miles.
Amount of current 12 miles, direction W.
ORGANISMS FROM
THE SURFACE.
Surface Organisms.-A few surface animals were taken in the tow-net from a boat,
including a beautiful young specimen of Rhizophysa.
Moseley writes : “ We seem to have got into a region where forms allied to Corycæus
abound ; I saw three species this morning. A large animal, which I believe to have been
a grampus (Orca gladiator), but which some of the sailors thought to bave been a shark,
was about the ship for some time. It appeared to be 20 or 25 feet long, and showed the
white on its belly and under side of the fins well ; I also saw the dorsal fin out of the
water once.”

.
At 6.45 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound and
dredge. At 8 A.M. sounded in 2025 fathoms, and at 8.45 A.M. put over dredge and current-
drag. At 9 A.M. boat put off to test current, and returned at 11 A.M. At 10 A.M.
naturalists went out in boat to collect surface animals. At 2 P.M. Siemens' resistance coil
was lowered and temperatures obtained at different depths. At 4 P.M. the dredge came
up empty, having fouled the lower part of the dredge-rope.
Position at noon, 1140 miles from Sombrero Island. Made good 84 miles. Amount
of current 16 miles, direction S. 74° W.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.-Moseley writes : “The tow-net put out at night (March 2–3)
brought up specimens of Phyllosoma, Lucifer, Corycæus, and Calanella [ = Eucalanus].
With a boat were obtained two specimens of Glaucus and several fine specimens of Porpita,
on which Glaucus is said to feed. Glaucus is very active in its movements and reminds one
rather of a turtle in the way in which it floats with its head up. When turned on its back
it recovers its position at once by a vigorous motion of its large swimming appendages.
Some shells of Spirula picked up on the surface were infested with Cirripeds, Acineta, and
