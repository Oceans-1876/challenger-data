THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 92.
The Station-book records also :-A soft Holothurian, and a small Sternoptychid fish
evidently from the surface.
Moseley writes : “ In the swabs was a Holothurian with gelatinous test, resembling
that of Salpa in appearance, and with curious simple-spoked wheels in the epidermis.”
ORGANISMS FROM

Surface Organisms.—A flying fish (Ecocoetus nigricans) came on board, but not many

of carbonate of lime (Station 93). At 10.30 A.M. completed sounding, stopped engines,
and made all plain sail. At 11.45 A.M. got up steam, and at 12.15 P.m. sounded
in 1000 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Mud, containing 13.65 per cent. of carbonate of
lime (Station 932). At 2 P.M. stopped and sounded in 465 fathoms, deposit Volcanic
Mud, containing 13.63 per cent. of carbonate of lime, bottom temperature 43°.5
(Station 93B). At 3 P.M. stopped and sounded in 52 fathoms, deposit Coralline Sand,
containing 94.20 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 93c). At 3.15 P.M. proceeded,
at 4 P.m. passed Bird Island, and at 4.15 P.M. stopped and anchored in 7 fathoms. The
four soundings taken to-day are in a line from the middle of the entrance of the channel
