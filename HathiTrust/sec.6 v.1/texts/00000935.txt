SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

Depth, 2800 fathoms ; deposit, Volcanic Mud, containing only a trace of carbonate Station 193.
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4 A.M. daylight, observed Bird Island. At 8.40 A.M. stopped and sounded in
2800 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid
was determined in water from 400 fathoms, and amounted to 40•0 milligrammes per litre.
At 11.45 A.m. proceeded. At 2.40 P.M. observed a water-spout. At 6.15 P.M. stopped
and sounded in 100 fathoms, no bottom. At 6.50 P.m. proceeded. At depths of 600 and
400 fathoms Mr. Buchanan got samples of a milky white water, the colour being due
to the presence of white particles which showed no structure under the microscope. This
white matter disappeared when treated with acid, apparently with effervescence. In
this connection, the Governor and other gentlemen at Banda said that in the months of
July and August the water had frequently a milky white appearance.
Distance at noon from Goonong Api Island, 69 miles. Made good 86 miles. Amount
of current 11 miles, direction N. 52º W.
