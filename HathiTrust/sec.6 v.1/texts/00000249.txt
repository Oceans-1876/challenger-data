At 6 A.M. sounded in 1900 fathoms, and at 7.30 A.M. put over dredge with i} cwt.
attached at 500 fathoms from it, with 2600 fathoms of rope. The tow-net had been out
all night, and in the morning was found to contain some interesting specimens. At
10 A.M. sent down a stop-cock water-bottle to 300 fathoms, and slip water-bottle to
the bottom, and obtained serial temperatures. At 1.30 P.M. commenced heaving in
dredge, which came up about 4 P.M. with several specimens.
