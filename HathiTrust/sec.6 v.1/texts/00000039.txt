PREFACE.
It may
The literature of the natural sciences during the past few years exhibits,
in a remarkable way, the profound influence our fuller knowledge of the
deep sea has had on all general conceptions concerning the modifica-
tions the surface of the earth is now undergoing and has undergone
in past geological times. This could not well be otherwise. When-
ever science is enriched by a large addition of new facts, a change
in theoretical views invariably follows. No complete theory of the earth
was possible so long as we were ignorant of the conditions prevailing over
the three-fifths of the globe covered by the waters of the ocean.
fairly be said that since the discoveries of Columbus, Gama, and Magellan
in the thirty years from 1492 to 1522, there has been no addition to the
knowledge of the surface of our planet that can in any way compare with
that acquired by the Challenger and other deep-sea expeditions during the
past quarter of a century.
The difficulties connected with the exploration of the deeper waters of
the great Ocean Basins arise from the fact that the vast majority of the
observations are from the nature of the case indirect. At the surface of
the ocean direct observation is possible, but our knowledge of the conditions
in deep water, and of all that takes place beneath the surface, is wholly
dependent on the correct working of instruments, the actions of which are, for
the time, hid from sight. A few years ago the apparatus necessary for the
