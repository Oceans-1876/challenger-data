Depth, 2650 fathoms; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 24:56 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Repard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9.30 A.M. stopped and sounded in 2650 fathoms. At 12.10 P.M. put trawl over.
Second gig away collecting surface animals. At 4.30 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl,
which came up at 6.20 P.M. containing a few specimens. The carbonic acid was
determined in water from the depth of 1 fathom, and amounted to 45.0 milligrammes
per litre.
Distance from Bermuda at noon, 162 miles. Made good 100 miles. Amount of current

ANIMALS FROM
TRAWL
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the trawl at this
Station :
OPHIUROIDEA (Lyman, Zool. pt. 14).
Ophioglypha bullata, Wyville Thomson, n.sp. Eight specimens ; obtained also at
Stations 45, 61, and 133.
Amphiura verrilli, n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
ECHINOIDEA (Agassiz, Zool. pt. 9).
Calymne relicta, Wyville Thomson, n.g., n.sp. Two specimens; obtained also near
Tristan da Cunha (?).
The Station-book records also empty worm-tubes and a shrimp.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The trawl brought up a shrimp, which evidently does not
belong to the group of deep-sea shrimps previously described, and some worm-tubes
formed of very many Foraminifera.”
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—Fine brown Medusæ, Tomopteris, Ianthina with egg-capsules,
and Heteropods, were taken on the surface.
