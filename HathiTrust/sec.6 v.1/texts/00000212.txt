THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION VI.
CIRRIPEDIA (Hoek, Zool. pt. 25).
Scalpellum insigne, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
Verruca obliqua, n.sp. Four specimens, and a fifth specimen probably representing
a variety ; obtained at no other locality.
POLYZOA (Busk, Zool. pt. 30).
Kinetoskias cyathus (Wyville Thomson), n.sp. Four specimens ; obtained also at
Station 325, 2650 fathoms.
In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book:—Two
specimens of Euplectella sp., Iphiteon sp., Tethya sp., fragments of Holtenia ( = Phero-
nema] or Asconema, several new Sponges, Hymenaster sp., six specimens of Ophiomusium
sp. and two of another species, Diadema sp., six specimens of Salenia sp., Stichopus (?)
sp., and a Molluscoid.
Excluding Protozoa, over 40 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at this
Station, belonging to about 20 species, of which 7 are new to science; 5 of the new
species were not obtained elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The worms brought up by the trawl include Nereis,
Sabellides, an Aphroditid, Clymene, and some fragments. They present nothing extra-
ordinary in their structure or morphology.”
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.— Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The little Phronima sedentaria was
got in the morning from the surface, and in its transparent house by the trawl. Only
the females have, according to Claus, a house; they are smaller than the males, have
more hairs on the antennæ, &c. A large specimen of Tomopteris was captured, but being
only slightly transparent was not kept.” Physalia is also recorded in the note-books.
