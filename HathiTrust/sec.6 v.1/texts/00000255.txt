mium). No gulf-weed was to be seen. At night four specimens of Halobates were taken
in the surface-net alive ; when diving the insect is covered with a film of air like its near
fresh-water relative Hydrometra, and swims in a very similar manner.

Surface Organisms.—Moseley writes : “A dolphin (Coryphæna)' about a foot long
was caught at the bows, this being the first. The boatswain hauled another much larger
one out of the water, but the hook broke. A line I put out astern pulled the jaws off
another. Gulf-weed is floating past again in considerable quantities, but still merely in
small masses. There are numbers of flying-fish about. The surface-net taken in at
6 A.M. contained Salpæ, Leptocephali, and Phyllosoma in abundance.”

At 7.15 A.M. put dredge over. At 9.30 A.M. sounded in 2650 fathoms. Took serial
temperatures at intervals of 50 fathoms down to 700 fathoms. At 2 P.M. commenced

Pyrosoma and a small fish with very minute eyes, possibly from the bottom. Life-boat
