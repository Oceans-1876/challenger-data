THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
NEW ZEALAND.
In addition, the Station-book records from Station 167A, 10 fathoms Balanus,
Gammarid, Isopod parasitic on Ophiurids, Sphæromidæ, Alcyonium, Cancer, Gelasimus,
Polyzoa (Caberea), compound Ascidian, and egg-capsules.
In the foregoing list about 79 species are recorded, of which 24 are new to science,
including representatives of 2 new genera; 19 of the new species were not obtained
elsewhere.
With reference to the dredgings in Queen Charlotte Sound (Station 167A, 10 fathoms),
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The facies of the fauna was more tropical than that of the
Port Jackson fauna, which is easily explained, seeing that the Polynesian fauna probably
extends to the shores of New Zealand; we are now in the periphery of another
geographical centre. Voluta vespertilio, Murex, and Typhis, as well as the fine Olivæ,
may be quoted in favour of this. The egg-capsules brought up belong probably to a large
Buccinum, in which genus it is known that the young ones leave the egg-capsules after
having lost their velum. This must be the case here, as one finds in each capsule three
to six young shells having the prodigious length of 4 mm. The Crustacea were
remarkable only for the presence of Gelasimus, the members of which generally live on
the beach, or even in holes on the land, and come only to the sea to deposit their eggs.
