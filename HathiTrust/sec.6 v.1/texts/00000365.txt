of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3.30 P.M. got up steam, and at 4 P.m. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded
under steam to sound. At 5 P.M. sounded in 2700 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures
at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms. Sent down German water-bottle, and
obtained sample of bottom water for analysis. At 7 P.M. completed temperatures, and
at 7.15 P.M. proceeded under all plain sail.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 960 miles. Made good 102 miles. Amount of current
18 miles, direction N. 19° E.
