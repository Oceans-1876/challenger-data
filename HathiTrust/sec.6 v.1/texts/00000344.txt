STATION 56,
Pleurotoma (Mangelia) acanthodes, n.sp. Obtained also at Station 75, 450 fathoms.
) tiara, n.sp. Obtained also at Station 24.
Cassis sp. (?). Fry, same as at Station 120, 675 fathoms.
Dunkeria falcifera, n.sp.
Obtained at no other locality.
Ringicula peracuta, n.sp. Obtained also at Stations 24 and 122.
The Station-book records also Pennatulid and Shrimp.
Excluding Protozoa, over 50 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at this
Station, belonging to about 35 species, of which 17 are new to science, including
representatives of 4 new genera; 4 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “Among the things brought up were only a few deep-sea
forms, but among shore things there were some forms interesting on account of the
depth into which they descend on the rocky shores of Bermuda, for example : a Galatheid
and Trochus containing Pagurus from 1000 fathoms.”

and sounded in 1250 fathoms, deposit Coral Mud, containing 84.75 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (Station 57A). At noon put over trawl. At 3 P.M. sounded in 1575 fathoms,
deposit Coral Mud, containing 89·11 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 57B).
Obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1000 fathoms. At 4
P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, but at 5.45 P.m. it fouled something at the bottom,
and the rope parted.
