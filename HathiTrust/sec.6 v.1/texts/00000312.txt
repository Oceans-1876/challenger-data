to 1500 fathoms, at intervals of 100 fathoms, to complete the series of the previous
evening. At 2 P.M. the temperature of the sea-surface suddenly rose from 65°5 to
71°•5, showing that the ship had slipped over the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream.
Owing to the cloudy and somewhat boisterous weather, little difference was observed in
the appearance of the water. At 8 P.M. the surface temperature reached 73°, while the
thermometer in the air stood at 64º. A flock of water-rails alighted on the rigging of
the ship, and several were caught by the sailors ; numerous stormy petrels were about the
ship.
Distance from Sandy Hook at noon, 308 miles. Made good 37 miles. Amount of
current 17 miles, direction N. 65° W.

At 6.30 A.m. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 7 A.M. com-
menced sounding. A considerable swell made the various operations somewhat difficult.
The line parted, and two thermometers, the hydra, and water-bottle were lost. In the
second sounding no bottom was found at a depth exceeding 2600 fathoms. At 1 P.M.
tried current at different depths, and obtained serial temperatures. During the ten hours
