Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02566; bottom, 1.02564.
Depth, 2150 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 87:90 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. shortened sail and put over trawl. At 9.15 A.M. furled sails, brought ship
to wind, and sounded in 2150 fathoms. At noon obtained a series of temperatures
down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom water, and
amounted to 52.6 milligrammes per litre. At 2 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which
came up at 4 P.M. nearly empty, having probably been very near, but never reached, the
bottom, as it contained no certain inhabitant of the bottom, nor any ooze. At 4.30 P.M.
made sail. The following birds were observed about the ship in this locality :-Diomedea
exulans, Diomedea fulminata, molly mawks, mutton birds, petrels, and some small
light-coloured birds flying over the sea at a distance.
Distance at noon from Cape Otway, 780 miles. Made good 56 miles.
