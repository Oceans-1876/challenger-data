THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Station 14.'
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1•02756.
Depth, 1950 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 70:43 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. trawl with beam of 22 feet was sent down. At 10 A.M. sounded in 1950
fathoms, and sent down slip water-bottle. The latter was embedded in the ooze, a portion
of which getting in between the cylinder and the lower surface, the water was not re-
tained in the bottle. A stop-cock water-bottle, which had been attached at 1000 fathoms
from the bottom, closed in lowering down, and in consequence collapsed in the deep
water. The trawl came up at 5 P.M. containing very few specimens. The beam was
broken through the centre, and otherwise most singularly twisted and torn by the great
pressure to which it had been subjected; the wood was compressed, so as to reduce the
diameter of the beam by half an inch, and the knots projected.
Sombrero Island distant at noon, 972 miles. Made good 110 miles. Amount of
current 12 miles, direction S. 37° W.
