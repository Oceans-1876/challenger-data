ORGANISMS FROM
THE SURFACE.
Surface Organisms.— Willemoes-Suhm writes : “At night a great many small speci-
mens of Pyrosoma were in the water, and some were taken in the tow-net. Also, an
Acridium came on board."
At St. Iago,
CAPE VERDES.
The Challenger remained at St. Iago from 7.30 A.M. on August 7 till 8.30 P.M. on
August 9, during which time the steam pinnace dredged and trawled with tangles on
the Red Coral ground, in 80 to 100 fathoms.
CAPE VERDES.
The expedition visited the Cape Verde Islands on the outward voyage from July 27
till August 9, 1873, and on the homeward voyage from April 16 till April 26, 1876
(for description of the islands, see Narr. Chall. Exp., vol. i. pp. 183–191). On both
visits, Mr. Murray conducted dredgings from the steam pinnace in the harbour of St.
Vincent in depths of 7 to 50 fathoms. The deposit was a Calcareous Sand, containing
87 to 94 per cent. of carbonate of lime, chiefly made up of Foraminifera and Calcareous
Algæ. In some places the shells of Amphistegina lessonii made up fully two-thirds of
the whole deposit. Polystomella, Discorbina, and Orbiculina were also abundant.
The deposits around the islands from 200 fathoms down to 1150 fathoms were Volcanic
Sands and Muds, containing from 13 to 50 per cent. of carbonate of lime, in which
Pteropod and Heteropod shells were abundant. The following species are recorded in
the Zoological Reports as having been obtained in the vicinity :
