Cook left little to be done by his successors in regard to the discovery of new lands,
but in the records of the splendid set of sea-voyages above enumerated, there are
inexhaustible materials dealing with the science of the earth and of man. Investigators
gradually directed their attention to the physical and biological conditions of the sea, and
to the study of the causes of oceanic phenomena, so that all these voyages added much
to our knowledge of terrestrial physics, hydrography, zoology, and botany. We shall
now endeavour to indicate the views held by navigators and scientific men on these
subjects, from the time of Cook down to the Challenger Expedition.
Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle ? distinguishes oceans, mediterraneans, and gulfs.
Oceans are those seas surrounding continents, which occasionally penetrate into the land
