Depth, 275 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 88.45 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).

containing 82-20 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 166B). At 10.35 P. M.
proceeded under steam.
Distance at noon from Cape Farewell, 199 miles. Made good 141 miles. Amount
