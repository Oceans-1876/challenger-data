At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam. At 7 A.M. sounded in 520
fathoms, deposit Volanic Mud (Station 170). Put trawl over. At 10 A.M. dingey went
away with naturalists for surface collecting. At 10.40 A.m. hove up trawl with numerous
specimens. At 11.45 A.M. put trawl over again, and sounded in 630 fathoms, deposit
Volcanic Mud, bottom temperature 39°:5 (Station 170A), midway between Macaulay and
Raoul or Sunday Islands. Obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 50 fathoms down
to 500 fathoms. At 4.30 P.M. hove up trawl containing many specimens, and at
4.35 P.M. proceeded under steam. No albatrosses were noticed to-day, and yesterday
only one specimen of Diomedea exulans and two specimens of Diomedea melanophrys
