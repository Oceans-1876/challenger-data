THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 179.
Lamellibranch and other shells, Heteropoda (Atlanta), Appendicularia. One thick-
shelled Orbulina was quite filled with sarcode of a yellowish colour, in which were many
greenish and reddish coloured cells, like the yellow bodies in Radiolaria. The sarcode of
the Globigerinæ had, in addition to yellow granular matter, many cells of a greenish
tinge, rounder and smaller than those in Orbulina, as well as many orange coloured oil-
globules. The endochrome of Pyrocystis and Ethmodiscus had a yellowish or greenish
tinge, and was very similar in both species.
August 22, 23, 1874.
On these dates stormy petrels and larger birds like puffins were seen, while boatswain
birds hovered over the ship at a great height, and a flock of sea-birds about the size
of terns were noticed at some distance from the ship. On the evening of August 22
a specimen of Sula piscator alighted on the cutter and was caught; in its stomach was
found a specimen of Ommastrephes oualaniensis (see Hoyle, Zool. pt. 44).
