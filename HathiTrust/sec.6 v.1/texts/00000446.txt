THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 104.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—The following species are recorded from the tow-nets sent down
to 100 fathoms :-
COPEPODA (Brady, Zool. pt. 23).
Saphirina metallina, Dana.
AMPHIPODA (Stebbing, Zool. pt. 67).
Oxycephalus clausi, Bovallius.
SCHIZOPODA (Sars, Zool. pt. 37).
Thysanopoda tricuspidata, M.-Edwards
(larval form).
Two or three hauls of the tow-net were taken at about 100 fathoms, and the net was
full of pelagic animals, while at the same time almost nothing was got at the surface. In
addition to the animals noted yesterday, Lucifer was present in abundance, young speci-
mens of Tomopteris, several specimens of Alciopa, and a Copepod with feathered setæ on
the furca.
Moseley writes : “ Yesterday and to-day Murray put down the surface-net to 100
fathoms. The result was most satisfactory, for the net was full of animals such as are
caught on the surface at night, while a similar net on the actual surface yielded next to
nothing. The water was perfectly swarming with living animals. It is a great step to
have discovered where the surface animals that one catches occasionally at night are to
be obtained, and where they live constantly, during the day.”
STATION 105.
Station 105 (Sounding 176), St. Vincent to St. Paul's Rocks (see Chart 12 and

At 4.5 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 5 P.M. sounded
in 2275 fathoms. Tried a new disengaging apparatus-working by means of a slot without
spring—but it failed to disengage the weights, which were brought to the surface.
