Depth, 2150 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 46.43 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and dredge. At
7.30 A.M. sounded in 2150 fathoms. At 8.30 A.M. put dredge over. At noon obtained
serial temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic
acid was determined in water from 100 fathoms, and amounted to 36'0 milligrammes
per litre; owing to a fault in the new water-bottle this was probably surface water.
At 3.30 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge, but at 4.10 P.M. the dredge-rope carried away,
and dredge, weights, &c., were lost. At 4.20 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Tristan da Cunha, 1572 miles. Made good 70 miles.
Amount of current 22 miles, direction S. 5° W.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.--The following species is recorded from the surface in this
locality :-
AMPHIPODA (Stebbing, Zool. pt. 67).
Scina cornigera (M.-Edwards).
A little phosphorescence was observed during the night of September 29–30, and two
hauls with the tow-net produced a few Pyrocystis and Foraminifera, Physalia, Diphyes,
Gleba, Alciopa, Phronima, Hyperia, larvæ of Squilla, Euphausia, Zoëæ, many specimens
of Halobates, Phylliroë, Glaucus, and flying-fish.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The tow-net procured several specimens of Halobates, the
marine representative of Hydrometra so well known from the surface of our ponds ;
there is another marine Hemipter, Belostoma, the representative of Nepa, which we have
