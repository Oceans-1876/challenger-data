From the above it will be seen that on December 26 and 27, 1873, the Challenger
sounded and dredged in the vicinity of Marion and Prince Edward Islands (for description
of the islands see Narr. Chall. Exp., vol. i. pp. 291-301). Four hauls with the dredge
were taken on the 26th-twice in 50 fathoms, once in 75 fathoms, once in 100 fathoms
(Station 144A); and on the 27th three hauls with the dredge were taken in 85, 140,
and 310 fathoms (Stations 145 and 145a). In the following list of species recorded in
the Zoological Reports the Stations are combined, the depth given being indicated :
