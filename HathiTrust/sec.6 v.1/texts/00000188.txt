The German War Ship “Gazelle,” under the command of Baron von Schleinitz,
circumnavigated the world at the same time as the Challenger, and was accompanied by
Studer and Börgen, to whom, as well as to other investigators, we are indebted for an
account of the observations made during the cruise on currents, deep-sea temperatures,
pelagic organisms, deep-sea deposits, and coral islands.?
“ DRACHE."
In the years 1881, 1882, and 1884, the ship “Drache” carried on investigations in
the North Sea, the physical, chemical, and biological results being made known through
reports by Jacobsen, Gümbel, Möbius, and others.
The International Polar Expeditions between 1882 and 1883, especially the German
Polar Expedition to South Georgia, yielded important meteorological and biological results
bearing more or less directly on the science of Oceanography.*
“NATIONAL
In the year 1889 the “ National” or Plankton
or Plankton Expedition spent from July to
PLANKTON EXPE- November in the North Atlantic, chiefly engaged in the study of the surface fauna and
flora after new methods suggested and carried out by Professor Hensen, an extension,
in fact, of the important marine work carried on for many years by the Kiel Commission.
This expedition was accompanied by a scientific staff consisting of Krümmel, Brandt,
Dahl, Fischer, Schütt, and Eschke. The collections have been placed in the hands of a
large number of specialists, and the detailed results are now in course of publication.
During the summers of 1876, 1877, and 1878, the Norwegian North Atlantic Expedi-
North ATLANTIC dition, in the “ Vöringen,” was despatched for the scientific investigation of the region
lying between Norway and Greenland, under the direction of Professors Mohn, G. O. Sars,
and other Norwegian experts. In the first cruise, from June 1 till August 26, 1876,
98 soundings were taken, the greatest depth being 1861 fathoms ; in the second cruise,
extending from June 11 till August 23, 1877, 160 soundings, 27 dredgings, 9 trawlings,
and 37 serial temperature observations were taken, the greatest depth being 2005 fathoms;
in the third cruise, extending from June 15 till September 4, 1878, 117 soundings, 15
dredgings, 24 trawlings, and 57 serial temperature observations were taken, the greatest
