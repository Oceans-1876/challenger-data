ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—The following
Station :
species are recorded from the surface at this
PELAGIC HEMIPTERA (White, Zool. pt. 19).
Halobates wüllerstorff, Frauenfeld.
FISHES (Günther, Zool. pt. 78).
Exocoetus obtusirostris, Günther, or Exocoetus evolans, Linné (young).
At
Besides the organisms mentioned yesterday, the following are recorded in the note-
books :-Diphyes, Sagitta, Planaria, Mysis, Phyllosoma, Halobates, Pneumonoderma-
like Pteropod, Cranchia, Salpa, and young Pleuronectids.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “At night the sea was very phosphorescent, and as the
ship was making only 3 or 4 knots several good hauls of the tow-net were obtained.
12.30 A.M. a great many animals were in the net, but an hour later very little was
procured; a squall was expected, and the sea might have been somewhat rougher, but
not much. Several Pleuronectids in different stages of growth, the largest an inch,
smaller ones 12 to 13 mm. in length, were obtained; they were perfectly symmetrical
and homocercal, and the largest specimen had some reddish spots, but genitals were not
observed. There was a large Phyllosoma measuring 4 inches between the tips of
the legs.”
Moseley writes : “Two large porpoise-like Cetacea were seen alongside. A pelagic
Cephalopod, apparently of the genus Cranchia, was taken ; it was perfectly transparent,
which allowed the structure and movements of organs to be seen.”
