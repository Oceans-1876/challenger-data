STATION 184.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02630; bottom, 1.02613.
Depth, 1400 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 52:64 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6 A.M. got up steam. At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under
steam to sound and trawl. At 7 A.M. sounded in 1400 fathoms, and put trawl over.
Obtained serial temperatures down to 500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined
in bottom water, and amounted to 36'1 milligrammes per litre. At 2.30 P.m. hove up
trawl containing many specimens, along with pumice-stones and cocoa-nuts. At 7.10 P.M.
