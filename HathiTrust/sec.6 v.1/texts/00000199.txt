.
At 7 A.M. sounded in 325 fathoms, Hard Ground, bottom temperature 52°:0 Stations Ia. to Ic.
(Station Ia.), and at 9 A.m. in 730 fathoms, Hard Ground, bottom temperature 49°-5
(Station IB.). At 11 A.M. sounded in 950 fathoms, Hard Ground (Station Ic.), but the
line carried away owing to a bad splice. At 11.30 A.m. put dredge over in about 1000
fathoms; it came up without mud at 4 P.M., having apparently not been on the bottom,
but contained one small fish, some small Crustacea, and Pteropoda. Between Vigo Bay
and Burlings Islands the tow-net was used. At night the sea showed luminosity due
apparently to small Crustacea.
Position at noon, about 40 miles west of Cape Mondego ; Burlings Islands distant 59
miles. Made good 86 miles. Amount of current 12 miles, direction N. 75º E.
Surface Organisms.-Crustacea and Pteropoda were obtained in the surface tow-net.

2 P.M.
At 9 A.M. sounded in 1975 fathoms, but the line was carried away, owing to a bad
splice, making the third sounding line and third thermometer which have been lost.
At 10.30 A.M. lowered dredge in about 2000 fathoms, and commenced heaving in at
At 9.20 P.M. the dredge-rope was carried away, about 2000 fathoms of line being
lost along with the dredge, which probably fouled something at the bottom, as there
was a heavy strain on the line, and only a fathom or two could be hauled in at a time.
Position at noon, about 40 miles N.W. of Burlings Islands, coast of Portugal. Made
good 30 miles. Amount of current 7 miles, direction S. 56° E.
