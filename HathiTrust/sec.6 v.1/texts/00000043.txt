the various dredging and trawling stations, which, in a manner, will serve as
index to the whole Report: for on turning to the station list, in which
the name of a species occurs, a reference will be found to the memoir
in which it is described in detail. I desire to acknowledge the services,
in the preparation of this index, of Mr. James Chumley, Mr. A. R. Scott,
Miss Sclater, Mrs. Weir, and Mrs. Murray.
The temperature diagrams and detailed charts showing the positions of
the Challenger sounding, temperature and dredging stations were originally
prepared by Staff-Commander Tizard, F.R.S., of the Hydrographic Office, for
the Narrative of the Cruise, and are now reproduced with additional infor-
mation. I am also indebted to Captain Tizard for supplying me with data
for the bathymetrical charts IA, IB, and Ic from the latest information
in possession of the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty.
In
constructing these bathymetrical charts, as well as the
charts, as well as the maps illustrating
the historical introduction, I have had much assistance from Mr. J. G.
Bartholomew and Mr. Frederick Bosse.
For many years I have been assisted in the Editorial and other work
connected with the Challenger Publications by Mr. James Chumley, and in
the preparation of these Summary Volumes for the press, as well as in the
correction of the proofs, I cannot speak too highly of the services Mr.
Chumley has rendered.
