less Pteropod, and the remains of a large Cephalopod.
Moseley writes: “Whales were seen constantly about the ship. I went away in a
boat to shoot birds, and saw a whale blow close by. The spout looks very different from
the level of the water in a boat than from the deck of a ship: it appears so much higher,
and shoots up into the air like a fountain. In the evening a whale was close alongside,
and the expiratory noise in blowing was of a loud, somewhat prolonged, deep bass tone.”
February 15, 16, and 17, 1874. On the 16th the Challenger reached her most
southerly point in lat. 66° 43' S.
Moseley writes : “During the afternoon of the 16th whales were extremely abundant,
both those with the small fin very far back, as well as shoals of a grampus-like Cetacean with
high pointed fins projecting out of the water as they swim, and looking like sharks' fins ;
on the side, behind the head, they had a white blotch, and a large light transverse patch
immediately behind the high dorsal fin, which was placed nearly in the middle of the body.”
In the afternoon of the 17th the sea was of a greenish colour, and the water was
found to be filled with many little spherical transparent masses, which were identical with
those Mr. Murray had observed in the Arctic Ocean. These minute Algæ can be seen in
the water with the naked eye, when the vessel is held towards the light; they have the
surface covered with little dots of a greenish or yellowish tinge, which when examined
under high powers were seen to be arranged in groups of four. A few hours later the
sea was blue, and these Algæ could not be observed in the water. Similar banks of these
Algæ were passed through on other days when in the neighbourhood of the Antarctic ice.
