Cunha).
At 3 A.M. on October 15, proceeded under steam S.W. At 6 A.M. stopped off Tristan
da Cunha settlement, named Edinburgh after H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, who
visited it in H.M.S. “Galatea” in 1867. Communicated with the shore. At 8 A.M. came
to in 19 fathoms. Landed exploring parties and surveying officers to obtain observations.
Visited the settlement and Mr. Green, the present head of the colony, consisting of 15
families, 86 individuals. The colonists live in houses built of large basaltic blocks
shaped with the axe, and made to fit each other closely, as there exists no lime on the
island to make mortar with. They possess a large stock of cattle, and a good supply of
meat and vegetables was obtained for the ship. Several of the inhabitants are engaged
in the whale fishery. As usual, the photographer was on shore, and obtained several
views. Exploring parties returned at 3 P.M., having obtained natural history and other
specimens. Heard of two German settlers on Inaccessible Island, who had not been
communicated with for many months, and were supposed to be dead. It was decided to
go and look for them. At 5 P.M. weighed anchor and proceeded. At 6 P.M. stopped and
sounded in 360 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Sand, containing 6.93 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (Station 135). At 6.20 P.m. proceeded. At 10 P.M. stopped engines, set fore
and aft sails, and lay to on port tack for the night to the north of Inaccessible Island.
