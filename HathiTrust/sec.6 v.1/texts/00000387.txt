TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pt 38).
(?) clava, n.sp. One specimen without Ascidiozooids, therefore the
genus is doubtful.
Excluding Protozoa, over 200 specimens of invertebrates were obtained in these
dredgings, belonging to 128 species, of which 37 are new to science, including repre-
sentative of 1 new genus ; 22 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
From the shallower water (50 to 90 fathoms) about 90 specimens were obtained,
belonging to 26 species, of which 6 were taken also in 450 fathoms; 5 of the species are
new, of which 3 were taken also in 450 fathoms. From the deeper water (450 fathoms)
about 120 specimens were obtained, belonging to 115 species, of which 36 are new.
The following species of Pteropoda, Heteropoda, and Diatoms were observed in the OrganiSMS FROM
