THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S CHALLENGER.
STATION 40.
Depth, 2675 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 45.83 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9.30 A.M. stopped to put over dredge. The small dredge was used with a bread-
bag lining to the net ; a 28 lb. weight was slung to the tangle bar and four tangles. At
2 P.M. sounded in 2675 fathoms. The weights had apparently not been detached, as in
hauling in there was a great strain, and the line finally parted, water-bottle and thermo-
meter being lost. Sent cutter away to try current. At 3.20 P.M. commenced heaving
in dredge. At 4.30 P.M. cutter returned. At 5.45 P.M. dredge came up with a small
quantity of ooze, two red shrimps, and a few fishes. Many stormy petrels were seen
about the ship.
Distance from Sandy Hook at noon, 420 miles. Made good 68 miles. Amount of
current 6 miles, direction N. 63º W.
