STATION 155.
Station 155 (Sounding 259), near Antarctic Ice (see Chart 23).
February 23, 1874; lat. 64° 18' S., long. 94° 47' E.
Temperature of air at noon, 32°:3; mean for the day, 31°:3.
Temperature of water at surface, 31°:0.
Depth, 1300 fathoms ; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 11.84 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 12.15 A.m. brought ship to wind, and hove to. At 2 A.M. proceeded. At 8 A.M.
numerous icebergs in sight. At noon 44 icebergs in sight. At 12.15 P.M. got up steam, and
at 12.45 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam S.S.E. At 4 P.M.
numerous icebergs in sight. At 5 P.M. 88 icebergs in sight. At 5.30 P.M. observed pack ice
from W.S.W. to S.S.E. At 5.45 P.M. stopped, and examined and sketched details of an
iceberg. At 6 P.M. proceeded S.E. At 7.30 P.M. stopped and sounded in 1300 fathoms.
No sign of Termination Land, numerous icebergs in sight, and pack ice from E. by
N. to S.W. At 8.30 P.M. stopped and lay to; day very fine and sunny, but little wind.
Observed flashes of aurora australis during the morning watch. Sighted during the day
several whales, Cape pigeons, terns, prions, sooty albatrosses, and shot specimen of
Procellaria glacialoides, with Tænia in its intestines and a Cephalopod beak in its stomach.
Distance at noon from Termination Land, 45 miles. Made good 84 miles. Amount
of current for last two days 20 miles, direction S. 61° E.
The dredge was sent down next morning (24th) at 4 A.M., about 10 miles north of
Station 155, but came up empty at 9.20 A.M., having probably never reached the
bottom; weather stormy. At 10 A.M. Mr. Murray went away in a boat and picked up
some discoloured portions of pack ice. The discoloration was, on examination, found
to be due to the presence of Diatoms, Infusoria, Globigerina, and small Crustaceans, some
of which were alive. Some water was carefully filtered through the finest linen cloth, with
the view of finding Coccospheres or Rhabdospheres, but none of these were observed, nor
had they been noticed on the surface or bottom since leaving the latitude of the Crozets.
