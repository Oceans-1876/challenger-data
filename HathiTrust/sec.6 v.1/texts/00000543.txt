SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
405
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02620; 20 fathoms, 1·02625; 50 fathoms, Station 140.
1.02616.
Depth, 1250 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 50·26 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3.15 A.M. stopped engines. At daylight observed land to E.N.E. At 6 A.M.
shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 7 A.M. stopped and sounded
in 1250 fathoms. At 8 A.M. completed sounding, and proceeded under steam and
sail, Table Mountain and the mountains surrounding Simon's Bay in sight.
At
11.30 A.M. obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 10 fathoms down to 100 fathoms.
At 12.30 P.M. completed temperatures, and proceeded under sail and steam. Got into
the warm current (62°:2 F. = 16°:8 C.) about 20 nautical miles S.W. of Cape of Good
Hope. Altered course as requisite, rounding the Anvil and Bellows Rocks. At 2 P.M.
rounded Cape of Good Hope, shortened and furled sail. At 3.35 P.M. stopped and came
to in 9 fathoms; moored ship. Refused pratique on account of case of yellow fever
which was reported to have occurred on board the ship at Bahia.

Good HOPE.
The Expedition remained at the Cape of Good Hope from October 28 till December
17, 1873. During the stay Mr. Murray packed up and catalogued all the deep-sea
collections made during the first year of the cruise. The sixty-four boxes containing
these collections were addressed to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, and were landed
at the dockyard to be forwarded to England. The following species are recorded in the
Zoological Reports as having been obtained during the stay, principally from Simon's
Bay and on shore at Sea Point, near Cape Town
ANIMALS FROM
MONAXONIDA (Ridley and Dendy, Zool. pt. 59).
