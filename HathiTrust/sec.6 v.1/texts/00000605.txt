over.
At 2.30 A.m. land obscured by mist, which continued nearly all day. At 8 A.M. got

sounded in 210 fathoms, deposit Hard Ground, gravel, shells (Station 148). Put dredge
Observed land to N.E. from masthead. At 11.30 A.M. hove up dredge with several
specimens. The carbonic acid was determined in surface water, and amounted to 47.4
milligrammes per litre. At 1.30 P.M. sounded in 550 fathoms, deposit Hard Ground,
gravel, shells (Station 148A). Sent down dredge, which came up 3.30 P.M. with a few
specimens. At 4 P.M. made sail, and proceeded with a good breeze from the N.W. Cape

Distance at noon from Bligh's Cap, Kerguelen Island, 700 miles. Made good 16 miles.
On January 3, 1874, near the Crozet Islands, four dredgings were taken, the
soundings giving depths of 210 and 550 fathoms (Stations 148 and 148A). In the
following list of species recorded in the Zoological Reports the two Stations are combined,
the depth being indicated :--
