THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER
STATION 130.
Depth, 2350 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 35:93 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam. At 7.30 A.M. put trawl
over, and veered 3500 fathoms. At 8.20 A.M. brought ship to wind, and proceeded
under steam to sound. Sounded in 2350 fathoms. At 9 A.M. obtained serial
temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid
was determined in bottom water, and amounted to 49:1 milligrammes per litre. At
2 P.M. commenced heaving in traw). At 6.30 P.M. the trawl came to the surface,
apparently heavily laden judging from the full extension of the accumulators, but at
the moment when the beam of the trawl appeared at the surface, the swivel between
the
rope and the chain carried away, and the trawl with its unknown burden sank, to
the intense disappointment of the naturalists and naval officers gathered on the bridge.
At 6.50 P.M. made all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Tristan da Cunha, 1235 miles. Made good 118 miles.
Amount of current 14 miles, direction S. 27° W.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—The following are recorded in the note-books from the tow-nets
hauled in twice from a depth of 100 fathoms :-Pyrocystis, Foraminifera, Radiolaria,
Cuboides, Alciopa, Hyalophyllum [= Saphirinella] and other Copepods, Phronima,
Hyperia, Lucifer, Decapod larvæ, and Cranchia.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “Remarkable among the surface animals is the male of
Phronima, which is rather rare and only recently described by Claus, also a very big
species of Lucifer not got before. There is apparently not much difference between the
fauna of the South and North Atlantic; the same animals occur again and again.”
