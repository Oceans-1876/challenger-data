STATIONS 23 TO
23B.
Stations 23 to 23B (Soundings 67 to 69), off Sombrero Island (sce Chart 7).
March 15, 1873.
Temperature of air at noon, 76°:8; mean for the day, 75°.8.
Temperature of water at surface, 76°:0.
At daylight observed land. At 6 A.M. sounded in 450 fathoms, deposit Pteropod
Ooze, containing 84.27 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 23). Put over dredge
and veered 800 fathoms. At 8.30 A.M. veered dredge-rope to 1000 fathoms. At
10 A.m. dredge came up with many specimens. At 10.30 A.M. sounded in 460 fathoms,
deposit Pteropod Ooze (Station 23A), and put over dredge. At 1.30 P.M. hauled in
dredge and proceeded to the north-west. At 2.15 P.M. sounded in 590 fathoms, deposit
Pteropod Ooze (Station 23B), and at 3 P. M. put over dredge, veering 1200 fathoms.
At 5.20 P.M. hove up dredge, and at 6 P.M. made all plain sail.
The haul of the dredge in the shallower water (450 fathoms, Station 23) was most
productive, as will be seen from the following list of species recorded in the Zoological
Reports, the only thing from the deeper water (590 fathoms) being fragments of a
Hexactinellid Sponge (Chonelasma sp.) :
HEXACTINELLIDA (Schulze, Zool. pt. 53).
Farrea sp. (?) One specimen.
Aphrocallistes bocagei, Wright. One specimen ; obtained also at Stations 24, 56,
343, and 344, 390 to 1075 fathoms. Recorded from
both sides of the North Atlantic.
Chonelasma sp. (?).
(?). Fragments from 590 fathoms.
ALCYONARIA (Wright and Studer, Zool. pt. 64).
Clavularia tubaria, n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
Acanella eburnea (Pourtalès). One specimen ; obtained at no other locality by the
Challenger. Recorded from West Indies.
Primnoella distans, Studer. One specimen; obtained also at Station 122, 120
to 400 fathoms. Recorded from South-West Pacific.
Juncella barbadensis, Duchassaing and Michelotti (?). Two small fragments ;
obtained at no other locality by the Challenger. Re-
corded from West Indies.

Pliobothrus symmetricus, Pourtalès. Obtained at no other locality by the
Challenger. Recorded from Florida and Key West, and
North Atlantic ("Porcupine ").
