brown colour, with brilliant white, sharply defined, areas, and thus closely resembles the
older darker pieces of Sargassum, which also are thickest covered with Membranipora.
Antennarius is of the weed colour, and the peculiar white spots on the body evidently
have a like signification. Even one of the Planarians living in the weed is yellow marked
with brown,
“In the morning when I was out in a boat Radiolarians had been scarce, but in the
forenoon it fell almost a dead calm, and Murray, going out in the afternoon after it had
been calm some time, found them on the surface in enormous abundance.”

ORGANISMS FROM

At daylight a spar of pitch pine was picked up and hauled on board. At 9.30 A.M.
obtained serial temperatures down to 300 fathoms. Cutter was lowered to try the
current, and jolly-boat for surface collecting.
Surface Organisms.-Moseley writes : “The spar of pitch pine was covered with a
Lepas (Lepas anatifera, Linné, see Hoek, Zool. pt. 25] in abundance, and numbers of
the small gulf-weed crab [Nautilograpsus minutus (Linné), see Miers, Zool. pt. 49].
The colour of the crabs here matched admirably with the dark coloured wood and white
Lepas-shells showing out in relief upon it. But I suspect that they are merely casual
visitors to such a log, and that their real home is the gulf-weed, the white patches being
imitative of the Flustra and not Lepas-shells, perhaps of both since a few Lepas-shells
are to be met with on the weed. A small brown Nudibranch (Æolis) was abundant on
the log, and there were plenty of its eggs disposed in small rounded white patches amongst
the bases of the Lepas-stems. These ova contained embryos in an advanced stage of
development; they seemed closely to resemble the embryos of Tergipes figured by
Selenka. Some Campanularians were the only other animals on the log, but there were a
few small Diatoms growing on it.
“ The tow-net, which for some time past has been almost barren, produced some very
fine specimens of Phyllosoma, a male Lucifer with spermatophores, larvæ of Squilla,
Nymphon, the yellow coloured gulf-weed Planarian, and several Leptocephali. A
dolphin was speared with the 'grains.'”
