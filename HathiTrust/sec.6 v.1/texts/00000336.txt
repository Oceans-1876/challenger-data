In addition to the foregoing, the Station-book records :-Euryale and two young
specimens of Chætoderma.
Excluding Protozoa, nearly 100 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at this
Station, belonging to about 23 species, of which 12 are new to science, including repre-
sentatives of 3 new genera; 7 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ Among the Crustacea was a Palæmonid with very thin and
elongated legs. Two young specimens of Chætoderma were apparently not different from
the one we got in the West Indies.”
