Station 9 (Sounding 53), Tenerife to Sombrero (see Chart 6 and Diagram 1).
STATION 9.
February 26, 1873 ; lat. 23° 23' N., long. 35° 11' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 75°:3 ; mean for the day, 70°.1.
Temperature of water at surface, 69°:0; bottom, 36°:8.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02778; bottom, 1.02653.
Depth, 3150 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing 3:11 per cent. of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At noon sounded in 3150 fathoms; while sounding a current-drag was put
down to a depth of 200 fathoms, and during the whole operation the ship scarcely moved
from her position. At 2.15 P.M. the dredge went down with two swabs, and, attached to
the iron bar below the dredge, a Hydra-detaching instrument with 3 cwt.; two weights
of 1 cwt. each, were attached to the line 200 fathoms in advance of the dredge, 3600
fathoms of line being paid out. At 4.45 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge, which came
up at 10.15 P.M. quarter full of Red Clay. This was the deepest dredging which had up
to that time been taken. The stem of the Hydra-machine had gone deep into the deposit,
and was bent apparently by the dredge and weights falling upon it. The dredge had
taken a deep scoop of the clay, and the line was entangled in a coil over the weights.
Sombrero Island distant at noon, 1607 miles. Made good 124 miles. Amount of
current 14 miles, direction S. 60° W.
FORAMINIFERA (Brady, Zool. pt. 22).— The following species of Foraminifera were ORGANISMS FROM
observed during the examination of the deposit at this Station (see also Murray and
THE DEPOSIT.
Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.); the pelagic species, which make up about 70
per cent. of the carbonate of lime present in the deposit, are marked thus x:-
Hyperammina ramosa, Brady.
Reophax nodulosa, Brady.
Haplophragmium rotulatum, Brady.
x Globigerina bulloides, d'Orbigny.
inflata, d’Orbigny.
pachyderma (Ehrenberg) (?).
x Globigerina rubra, d'Orbigny.
x Orbulina universa, d'Orbigny.
Truncatulina pygmæa, Hantken.
Pulvinulina crassa (L'Orbigny).
menardii (d’Orbigny).
micheliniana (d'Orbigny).

Two species of Radiolaria (Haliomma horridum, Stöhr, and Octopyle hexastyle,
Haeckel) were also observed in the deposit, of which Professor Thomson wrote : “In the
last few Stations the mud has been gradually altering its character, becoming less calcareous
and less rich in Foraminifera. This mud consists almost entirely of reddish clay in a
state of excessively fine division ; it scarcely effervesces with acid, and there is an almost
total absence of calcareous shells. No living thing could be detected except one or two
Foraminifera with tests of fine brown grains."
