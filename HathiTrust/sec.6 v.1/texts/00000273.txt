STATION 24.
At 11.10 A. M. sounded in 625 fathoms, deposit Pteropod Ooze, containing 68.88 per cent.
of carbonate of lime (Station 24A). Put over dredge and veered 1100 fathoms. Dredge
became fast at the bottom, but when freed a considerable quantity of mud was brought up.
While hauling in the dredge, a block hook of the dredging apparatus gave way, and
a boy was killed by being struck with the block.
The position of this dredging-ground is about 15 miles north of Culebra Island, the
whole
group of the Virgin Islands being in sight. At 8 P.M. made all plain sail.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the dredge at this
Station, the only species from the greater depth (625 fathoms) being Rhizocrinus
lofotensis :-
