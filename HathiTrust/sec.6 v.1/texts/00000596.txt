Depth, 1600 fathoms; deposit, Diatom Ooze, containing 34:63 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. got up steam. At 9.20 A.m. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded
under steam to sound and trawl. At 10 A.M. put trawl over, veering 2000 fathoms. At
11 A.M. sounded in 1600 fathoms. At 1.20 P.M. obtained serial temperatures. The
carbonic acid was determined in water from the surface and 100 fathoms, and
amounted respectively to 54.2 and 56:9 milligrammes per litre. At 4.45 P.M. the trawl
came up with numerous specimens,—even a more remarkable haul than yesterday's. A
tow-net was sent down on the trawl line, but did not work successfully. At 4.50 P.M.
made all plain sail. At 10.15 P.M. observed Hog Island on port bow. In the course of
the day saw several albatrosses, Cape pigeons, many prions, and a few petrels. About
7 P.M. several whales were in sight.
