SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 87.
Excluding Protozoa, about a dozen specimens of invertebrates were obtained at
this Station, belonging to 7 species, of which 4 are new to science, including repre-
sentative of 1 new genus ; 2 of the new species and the new genus were not obtained
elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : "In the dredge was a shrimp, probably a Peneid, which
apparently shows that these animals live on the bottom, for it is improbable that a shrimp
could penetrate deeply into the mud during the passage of the dredge through the
surface water. There was also a transparent, very spiny, blind larva of a Brachyurous
crab [ = Eryoneicus cæcus), probably answering to the Megalopa-stage, but remarkable, in
addition to its blindness, for the development of the first pair of cheliferous legs and the
presence of only one largely developed, and three very slightly developed, pairs of
pereiopods, though the swimmerettes were normal. Of the internal organs one could see
a bright-red stomach and, on both sides of it, a yellow liver. The spines were placed in
rows on the carapace, and also covered the legs and abdomen, but there was no very spiny
rostrum, which, however, might appear in a subsequent stage. The full-grown crab to
which this larva belongs is evidently blind, and might bear some resemblance to the
Pericera-like crab taken on July 10 [ = Lithodes agassizii], which, however, had a pair of
well-developed eyes and a rostrum composed of strong spines. This is, as far as I am aware,
the first instance of a larva of a deep-sea Crustacean being brought up in the dredge.”
A longicorn beetle (Clytus) was blown on board, perhaps from Africa.
