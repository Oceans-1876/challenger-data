surface Mysidæ or Euphausidæ, which will be difficult. Of Phronima, the vagant male,
with its clypeiform anterior antennæ, was present again, along with another Amphipod,
which I have not seen before. Except the larvæ of Crustacea, one seldom observes a
larva of any kind, which shows clearly that the larvæ of most animals living at the bottom
do not ascend to the surface, for we are here probably on rich ground, the depth being
2000 fathoms, and the mud brought up by the sounding apparatus shows plenty of
organic material.”

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02626 ; bottom, 1.02587.
Depth, 1900 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 86:04 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.30 A.M. got up steam.
At 7.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 8.20 A.M.
put trawl over, veering 2500 fathoms, and sounded in 1900 fathoms. At 1.20 P.m.
commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 3.20 P.M. with numerous specimens. At
3.30 P.m. made all plain sail, and shaped course towards Tristan da Cunha. A specimen
of Procellaria gigantea was caught on the upper
deck.
Distance at noon from Inaccessible Island, 410 miles. Made good 133 miles.
Amount of current 16 miles, direction N. 64° E.
