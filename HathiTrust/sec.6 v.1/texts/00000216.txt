;
Volcanic Mud, containing 11.84 per cent. of carbonate of lime, bottom temperature 45°:0
(Station VIIM.) ; at 8.40 A.M., in 975 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Mud, bottom temperature
41°:0 (Station VIIN.); at 10 A.M., in 560 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Mud, containing
25.93 per cent. of carbonate of lime, bottom temperature 45°:5 (Station VIIo.); at 10.30
A.M., in 78 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Sand, containing 45:09 per cent. of carbonate of
limè (Station VIIP.). At the same time dredgings were taken in shallow water, the
animals noted below being recorded, but at 3.30 P.M. the dredge-rope parted and the
dredge was lost, having fouled something at the bottom. Soundings were then taken in
179 fathoms, Hard Ground (Station VIIQ.); at 5 P.M., in 640 fathoms, deposit
Volcanic Mud, containing 31•70 per cent. of carbonate of lime, bottom temperature 45°:8
(Station VIIR.); and at 5.45 P.M., in 1390 fathoms, deposit Volcanic Mud, bottom
temperature 38°5 (Station VIIs.). Proceeded thence under steam round the north-east
extremity of the island.
