At 8 A.m. passed small quantity of gulf-weed. At 11.30 A.M. shortened and furled
sails and got up steam to sound. At 1 P.M. sounded in 2325 fathoms, and sent down
thermometer and slip water-bottle. At 2 P.M. life-boat was lowered, and naturalists went
away to collect gulf-weed and surface animals; returned at 4.45 P.M. Took serial
temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500 fathoms, and proceeded
under all plain sail.
Sombrero Island distant at noon, 844 miles. Made good 126 miles. Amount of
current 11 miles, direction N. 69° W.
Surface Organisms.— The following are recorded in the note-books as having Organisms from
been procured among the gulf-weed :-Campanularia ; Dendrocelous Planarians, the SURFACE.
Spirorbis; Lepas, Balanus, Mysis, Palæmon (?), Nautilograpsus, larger Brachyuran ;
Scyllæa pelagica; Flustra; Antennarius. A grampus and many flying-fish were seen
this morning.
Moseley writes: “We now began to see plenty of patches of gulf-weed (Sar-
gassum bacciferum). I was astonished at its light yellow colour, as I had only seen
dark dried specimens. Amongst the weed procured with a boat were the nests of the
well-known little fish Antennarius. The nests consist of irregularly spherical masses of
the weed, fastened together by means of highly elastic threads, which look like wetted
cotton, indeed I took it for such at first sight; in the centre of the masses are the
eggs. A fish was caught and was observed to use his pectoral fin as a regular
prehensile organ to lay hold of the weed with ; the end of the long armed fin looks
very like the hand of a frog.”
