STATION 64.
naturalists. At 3 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge, which came up at 5 P.M. with
about a cwt. of ooze. At 5.25 P.M. proceeded under steam.
Distance from Fayal at noon, 1055 miles. Made good 22 miles. Amount of current
17 miles, direction N. 76° E.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the dredge at this
Station :
ANIMALS FROM
DREDGE.
OSTRACODA (Brady, Zool. pt. 3).
Cythere dictyon, n.sp. Widely distributed (see Station 24).
acanthoderma, n.sp. Obtained also at Stations 73, 146, 191A, 246, 296,
and 302, 580 to 2750 fathoms.
Krithe tumida, n.sp. Obtained also at Station 323, 1900 fathoms.
Xestoleberis expansa, n.sp. Obtained also at Station 323, 1900 fathoms.
POLYZOA (Busk, Zool. pt. 30).
Farciminaria delicatissima, n.sp. Obtained also at Stations 13, 14, 68, 89, and
106.
The Station-book records also :-Ophioglypha bullata, worm-tubes, and a Priapulid.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The dredge brought up some worm-tubes, probably
containing the Pectinaria-like animal obtained yesterday. There was also a Priapulid,
16 mm. in length and 3 mm. in breadth, but very much spoiled. The pharynx was
everted and covered by papillæ not, as in Priapulus caudatus, by teeth. The intestine
was clearly traceable, though not down to the anus, and was partly filled with mud.
The first caudal appendage resembled that of the northern species in form and transparent
consistency, but the little rods and buds were absent ; there was some pigment and an
opening at the end of the caudal appendage, which did not seem to have been fractured.
The walls of the body showed very marked longitudinal fibres.”
The following species of Radiolaria and fragment of Diatoms were observed in the OrganisMS FROM
deposit from this Station :-
THE DEPOSIT,
RADIOLARIA (Haeckel, Zool. pt. 40).
Cenosphæra lethe, Haeckel.
Staurolonche hexagona, Haeckel.
Spongolarcus amphicentria, Haeckel.
DIATOMACEÆ.—Mr. Comber says: “I examined carefully a large quantity of material,
but found no trace of any Diatom, except a fragment of a Coscinodiscus of the 'radiatus'
group, probably Coscinodiscus radiatus, Ehrenberg.”
