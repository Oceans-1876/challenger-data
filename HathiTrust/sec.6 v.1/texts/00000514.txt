under sail for the rest of the day. Flights of birds, chiefly Cape pigeons and albatrosses,

ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—The following species are recorded from the surface at this
Station :
COPEPODA (Brady, Zool. pt. 23).
Saphirina reticulata, n.sp.
Saphirinella stylifera (Lubbock).
TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pt. 76).
Appendicularia sp. (?).
In addition the following are recorded in the note-books :—Peridinium, Foraminifera,
compound Radiolaria, Cydippe, very large specimens of Tomopteris, Calanus, and
Spirialis rostralis [= Limacina inflata). From 100 fathoms :-Foraminifera, Radiolaria,
Hyalophyllum pellucidum [ = Saphirinella stylifera] and other Copepods, Phromina,
Hyperia, Dexamine, and many Decapod larvæ in the megalopa stage.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “There were many larvæ of Decapoda. Where do they come
from? They are probably not all larvæ of surface animals, though that may be so.
Perhaps they come up from deep water and sink when full grown. It will be necessary
