THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Diatoms, Radiolaria,
Diphyes, Sagitta, larvæ of Annelids, Themisto, Phronimids, larvæ of Squillids, Decapod
larvæ (Nauplii and Zoëæ), Appendicularia, larvæ of Ascidians.
A fine tow-net put over the stern of the ship in the harbour on June 10 and 11
procured Foraminifera (Globigerina, Cristellaria, and Rotalia, the last two genera
having been evidently washed up from the bottom by tidal currents), Acanthometræ,
Sagitta, many Copepods, larvæ of Cirripeds, Lucifer, young Lamellibranchs, larvæ of
Ascidians in the tailed condition and in the egg (which Murray thought might be the
larvæ of Appendicularia, seeing it was also present in the net, while Willemoes-Suhm
thought they were the larvæ of Ascidia).
