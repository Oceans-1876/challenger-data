tures.
At 6.35 A.M. put dredge over. Shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound
and dredge.
At 9 A.M. sounded in 2700 fathoms. At 10 A.M. obtained serial tempera-
At 1 P.m. obtained specimens of water at different depths to ascertain the specific
gravity. The carbonic acid was determined in surface water, and amounted to 48.0
milligrammes per litre. At 2.45 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge, which came up at
5 P.m. with a large quantity of Red Clay. On sifting the deposit the only animal of the
higher groups obtained was a small bright scarlet Caridid shrimp, along with some large
bottom-living Foraminifera. Numerous patches of gulf-weed passed the ship during the day.

yielded Oscillatoriaceæ and a few gulf-weed animals, but it was not till March 31 that the
weed appeared in large patches, and the Crustacea, &c., inhabiting it were obtained in
abundance. Several small, apparently young, flying fish, a Syngnathus, and two rather
large specimens of Antennarius were caught, and Radiolaria were in enormous abundance.
STATION 30.
Station 30 (Sounding 77), St. Thomas to Bermuda (see Chart 6 and Diagram 2).
April 1, 1873; lat. 29° 5' N., long. 65° 1' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 76°:3; mean for the day, 730.5.
Temperature of water at surface, 72°:0; bottom, 36°:5.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02735; bottom, 1:02774.
Depth, 2600 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing 28.88 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 10.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails. Lowered jolly-boat and second gig for col-
lecting surface animals and gulf-weed, of which large quantities were seen in the course
of the day. At 1 P.M. sounded in 2600 fathoms.
Distance from Bermuda at noon, 191 miles. Made good 76 miles. Amount of
current 4 miles, direction N. 61° E.
