SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 1.
Density of water at 60° F. at surface, 1.02730; bottom, 1.02650.
Depth, 1890 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 50 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. sounded in 1890 fathoms, when a water-bottle was sent down for the
first time with the sounding lead. At 9 A.M. the dredge was put over.
At noon
Siemens' thermometric apparatus was tried for the first time down to a depth of 1000
fathoms, with fair results. At 1.30 P.M. commenced to haul in dredge, and at 2 P.M.
obtained temperatures at various depths by means of thermometers and Siemens' apparatus.
The dredge came up empty at 4 P.M., having probably fouled the rope in paying out.
Position at noon about 40 nautical miles south of the southern extremity of Tenerife
Island; Sombrero Island distant 2620 miles. Made good 76 miles. Amount of current
8 miles, direction S. 75º W.

been captured in the surface tow-nets, which skimmed the surface only as the vessel was
moving fast :-Siphonophoræ, Copepods, Idothea, Lucifer, Phyllosoma, many Zoëæ,
Cavolinia, Styliola, two empty shells of Spirula.
Willemoes-Suhm writes: "I found a young specimen belonging to the Saphirinæ
with two long pigment bodies, but only one large cornea; perhaps it may divide later,
or it may be that this is a species in which the cornea is undivided. We found for the
first time the singular genus Lucifer, which is referred by Claus to the Decapods, and
by Gerstaecker to a family intermediate between the Squilline and the Schizopods.”
Station 2 (Sounding 46), Tenerife to Sombrero (see Chart 6 and Diagram 1).
