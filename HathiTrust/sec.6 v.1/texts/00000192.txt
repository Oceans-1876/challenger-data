THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
1
Dr. Gerhard Schott's observations on currents, temperature, and specific gravity of sea-
water, on a sailing voyage to China, show how important additions to oceanographical
knowledge can be made on such a voyage.
The great advances in the Science of Oceanography during recent years, through the
researches and expeditions indicated above, will be evident to all who may compare
the
knowledge possessed thirty years ago with what is now known concerning the depth of
the ocean, as represented on the bathymetrical charts which accompany these volumes,
with the data in regard to the temperature and specific gravity of the ocean at dif-
ferent depths as exhibited on the maps in Dr. Buchan's Report on Oceanic Circulation,
or with the information on the biology of the Great Ocean Basins contained in
the following pages.
