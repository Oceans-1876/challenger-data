Density at 60° F. at surface, 1•02774; bottom, 1•02753.
Depth, 2720 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing 13.30 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 7.30 A.M. sounded in 2720 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures at intervals of
10 fathoms down to 100 fathoms, thence at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1500
fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in the bottom water, and found to amount
to 40:0 milligrammes per litre.
Distance from Sombrero Island at noon, 1141 miles. Made good 110 miles. Amount
of current 12 miles, direction S. 69° W.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—Moseley writes :
“ Went out in a boat about 1 P.M.; sun very
hot and sea rough. I saw one Velella and caught a few Copepods, amongst them a
Corycæus, and one or two Radiolarians, one of which last was a social one like Collosphæra,
but with an intensely violet coloration of the whole contents of each capsule, except the
central vesicle. The surface was, however, on the whole very barren; in fact, as oceanic
animals generally come to the surface usually in calm weather, it is difficult to understand
what their habits must be in the region of the trades. Are there very few in that region ?
or do those there never come to the surface ? or is the fauna different? Three flying
fish were seen in the early morning, but they are very scarce.”
Willemoes-Subm made drawings of a small Copepod (male and female), which he thus
describes : “It is 0.87 mm. long, and 0.35 mm. broad. The genus to which it belongs
