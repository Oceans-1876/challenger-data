At 6.30 A.M. weighed anchor and proceeded out of Simon's Bay on the voyage to the
Antarctic ice and Australia. At 1.35 P.M. stopped and sounded in 98 fathoms on the
edge of the Agulbas Bank. Put dredge over, and obtained serial temperatures at intervals
of 10 fathoms down to the bottom. At 3.30 P.m. hove up dredge with numerous specimens,
and sent it down again at 4 P.M. At 5 P.m. hove up dredge with many specimens,
