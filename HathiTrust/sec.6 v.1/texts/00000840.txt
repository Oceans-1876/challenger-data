ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
August 13, 14, 1874.
Surface Organisms.—On these dates the tow-net was used several times, but never
far below the surface, the following being procured :-Spherical Algæ (Halosphæra),
Ethmodiscus and other Diatoms, Pyrocystis, Globigerina, Orbulina, Radiolaria,
Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta, many Copepods (especially Saphirina), Phronima,
Hyperia, Lucifer, Zoëæ and many larval Crustacea, larval Lamellibranchs, Atlanta,
Styliola, Heterofusus [= Limacina], and many other pelagic shells, small Cephalopods
(Cranchia, &c.), Salpa, and small fish. From the stomach of a Salpa were obtained
many Rhabdospheres and Coccospheres of various forms, a number of small Radiolaria
and other siliceous organisms, and a single Diatom.
It
may be remarked that in examining the deposit from 1350 fathoms (Station 175)
not a single shell of Pteropods, Atlanta, or other pelagic Molluscs, was observed, although
they occurred in the tow-nets at the surface in much greater abundance than the Foraminifera,
which latter made up about 80 per cent. of the carbonate of lime present in the ooze.
