THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 84.
At 4 A.M., daylight, observed Madeira Island astern. Under sail the whole fore-
noon, with a stiff breeze from the N.E., ship rolling occasionally. At 1.30 P.M. shortened
and furled sails, and got up steam to obtain serial temperatures down to 1000 fathoms.
At 3.45 P.M. completed temperatures, and at 4 P.M. made all plain sail. Depth here
according to Admiralty charts about 2400 fathoms.
Distance at noon from Palma Island, Canaries, 115 miles ; from St. Vincent, Cape
Verdes, 920 miles. Made good 120 miles.
[Stochasmus exilis is given by Spence Bate, and Ophiomitra chelys by Lyman, as from
this Station, but they are both evidently from Station 85.]
