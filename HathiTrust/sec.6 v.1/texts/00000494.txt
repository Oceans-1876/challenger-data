THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Stations 125 TO
126A.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ The trawl brought up a great many shrimps, including
a Caridid with many spines, while the Peneids were represented by several forms got before.
One of them, 3 inches in length, had a long rostrum and very long outer flagella ;
another had legs three times the length of its body and terminated by tufts of hairs.
There was also a male specimen of Gnathophausia zoëa, and a fragment of another
Schizopod. Among the worms a long Nemertean was found, showing the mouth and
lateral organs, but no orifice of the proboscis.”
