STATION 75.
July 2, 1873 ; lat. 38° 38' N., long. 28° 28' 30" W.
Temperature of air at noon, 70°:8; mean for the day, 68° :6.
Temperature of water at surface, 70°:0.
Depth, 450 fathoms; deposit, Volcanic Mud, containing 20:59 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. got up steam, and at 11 A.M. weighed anchor and proceeded under steam

sounded in 450 fathoms, and sent down dredge, which brought up numerous specimens.
At 5 P.M. made all plain sail, and shaped course for San Miguel, the principal island of
