STATION 73.
n.sp. (?).
Scaphander punctostriatus (Mighels). Obtained also at Stations 24 and 78.
gracilis, n.sp.
Obtained also at Station 78, 1000 fathoms.
Utriculus leucus, n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
Specimen in bad condition.
Cylichna ovata, Jeffreys. Obtained also at Stations 24, 75, 78, and 122.
Rotella (?) sp.
BRACHIOPODA (Davidson, Zool. pt. 1).
Terebratula vitrea (Born), var. minor, Philippi. One specimen and fragments ;
obtained also at Stations 24 and 142.
In addition to the foregoing, the following are recorded in the Station-book :—Three
specimens of a second species of Salenia, two specimens of Echinocyamus pusillus, and
two species of Polyzoa.
Excluding Protozoa, nearly 100 specimens of invertebrates were obtained at this
Station, belonging to about 59 species, of which 29 are new to science, including repre-
sentatives of 4 new genera; 10 of the new species were not obtained elsewhere.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “From the animals brought up by the dredge no very
definite conclusions can be drawn, as most of them have rather a neutral European deep-
sea character. The new Gnathophausia, Pagurus, and the big Flabellum are perhaps
peculiar to the Azores plateau.”
