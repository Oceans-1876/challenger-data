SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

Station 176.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02636; bottom, 1.02621.
Depth, 1450 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 62:41 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. got, up steam. At 9.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails, proceeded
under steam, and sounded in 1450 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to
500 fathoms. At 11 A.m. completed observations and proceeded. The carbonic acid
was determined in bottom water, and amounted to 45.9 milligrammes per litre. A
gannet and a tern were observed, and a dark coloured bird was also reported, but
birds were rarely observed from the ship.
Api Island distant at noon, 340 miles. Made good 76 miles. Amount of current
22 miles, direction W.

locality :-
THE SURFACE.
Fishes (Günther, Zool. pt. 78).
Exocoetus naresiï, n.sp. One specimen (came on board ship on August 16, 1874).
This specimen came in at one of the ports while the ship was going
at the rate of 7 or 8 knots, and nearly all the scales were off.
