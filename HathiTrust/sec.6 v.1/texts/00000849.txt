Depth, 2450 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing about 1 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6 A.M. shortened and furled sails and got up steam. At 7 A.M. sounded in
2450 fathoms. At 8 A.M. obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. At
10 A.M. completed observations, and at 10.20 A.M. made all plain sail. The carbonic
acid was determined in bottom water, and amounted to 43.4 milligrammes per litre.
Raine Island distant at noon, 579 miles. Made good 138 miles. Amount of current
7 miles, direction N. 44° W.
Surface Organisms — The following were taken in the tow-nets sent down to about ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
20 fathoms :-Pyrocystis, Globigerina, Orbulina, Pullenia, Pulvinulina menardii,
Acanthometra, many forms of Siphonophoræ, Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta, Alciopa and
other Annelids, Aphroditacean larvæ, larvæ of Balanoglossus, Cypridina, Saphirina,
many Crustaceans and larvæ, larval Lamellibranchs, Atlanta, Pteropods and larvæ, small
blue Salpæ, Appendicularia. The sarcode in Pullenia was bright red, sometimes
surrounding the shell, and in one case a Coscinodiscus was noticed in it.
Station 181 (Sounding 311), Fiji to Raine Island (see Chart 27 and Diagram 13).
STATION 181.
August 25, 1874; lat. 13° 50' S., long. 151° 49' E.
Temperature of air at noon, 78°:3 ; mean for the day, 77°•2.
Temperature of water at surface, 80°:0; bottom, 35°:8.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02649; bottom, 1.02591.
Depth, 2440 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, consisting of two layers, the upper
containing 6:42 and the lower 32-28 per cent. of carbonate of lime (see
Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 11 A.M. got up steam. At 11.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails and proceeded
under steam to sound and trawl. At 1 P.M. put trawl over, and veered 3000 fathoms.
At 2 P.M. sounded in 2440 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from the
surface, and amounted to 35.6 milligrammes per litre. At 5 P.M. commenced heaving
in trawl, which came up at 7.45 P.M. with a few specimens and some pumice-stones.
