deep-sea dredgings; the shallow-water species always appear to inhabit the deepest
places in the locality and are true mud-animals. Annelids în tubes were abundant, and
there was a very fine and soft animalſ = Buskiella abyssorum] with tentacles on the head,
and long white bristles which are very clearly jointed, a condition unknown, as far as I

day : a few Pyrocystis, Foraminifera, Radiolaria, Sagitta, Planarians, Saphirina,
Corycæus, Lucifer. From net sent down to 100 fathoms : Corycæus and the Distomum
which lives on the Copepods. At night: Pyrocystis present but not in great quantities;
many Globigerinæ ; Corycæus, Squilla larvæ, and Phylliroë very common.
Moseley writes : “At noon a shoal of dolphins (apparently Delphinus delphis)
accompanied the ship. The tip of the snout was white, and pig-like in shape; the dorsal
fin was somewhat behind the centre of the back. The body was dark brownish, except on
the ventral surface, which was white; some specimens were somewhat mottled on the
belly. I saw several turn right over, so as to fall tail first. They were to be seen
constantly swimming four or five, or sometimes as many as ten, close side by side, their
bodies touching and snouts in line, their motions being performed together, heads coming
out and tails disappearing all together. Some parties remained thus jammed together
for an hour at least.”
