over.
At 7 A. M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and trawl. Put trawl
At 8 A.m. brought ship to wind, and sounded in 2275 fathoms. ' At 9.30 A. M.
obtained serial temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down to 1000 fathoms.
Obtained specimens of water from different depths. The carbonic acid was determined in
water from 1000 fathoms, and amounted to 55'6 milligrammes per litre. At 3 P.M.
commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 4.30 P.M. nearly empty, containing only
a polyp and a sandy Foraminiferous tube attached to the ear-bone of a Ziphius, a small
piece of Cetacean bone, and two pieces of pumice, about the size of hens' eggs, one with
egg-capsule of Mollusc (?) attached. At 5.40 P.m. made sail. About 8.45 P. M. the
wind shifted very suddenly from W.N.W. to S.W. and then to S.E. by S. accompanied
by rain. The first albatross was seen on October 4.
Distance at noon from Tristan da Cunha, 912 miles. Made good 55 miles.
Amount of current 4 miles, direction S. 50° W.

Between 7 and 9 P. M. the tow-net procured many specimens of Collosphæra and
Physalia, while between 9 and 11 P.m. Phylliroë and Crustacea, which were nearly or
quite absent in the first haul, were taken. A lead was attached to the net, but, though
the ship was going only 3 knots, it did not sink far below the surface. In addition
to the organisms already mentioned, the following are recorded in the note-books :-
Small Medusæ, Diphyes, Alciopa, Tomopteris, many Copepods, Phronima, Cystisoma,
Oxycephalus, Hyperia, Isopod, Lucifer (two large, and a few small ones), Atlanta,
