Surface Organisms.—The following species are recorded from the surface in the Station 150.
ORGANISMS FROM
vicinity of this Station :-
SURFACE-NETS.
ANNELIDA (MʻIntosh, Zool. pt. 34).
Tomopteris carpenteri, Quatrefages (?).
PTEROPODA (Pelseneer, Zool. pt. 65).
Limacina australis (Eydoux and
Souleyet).
Clio sulcata (Pfeffer).
AMPHIPODA (Stebbing, Zool. pt. 67).
Vibilia antarctica, n.sp.
Euthemisto thomsonii, Stebbing.
TUNICATA (Herdman, Zool. pt. 76).
Salpa cylindrica, Cuvier.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Ctenophoræ, Sagitta
young Aphroditaceans, Copepods, Hyperia, and Euphausia. At times the surface-net
was full of living Diatoms, in masses forming a yellowish slime, among which could
be distinguished small Globigerinæ and Radiolarians. When dragged at a depth of
100 fathoms, the tow-nets produced similar results.
The ship anchored in Corinthian Bay, Heard Island, at 3.40 P.m. on February 6, and At Heard Island.
one boat's party landed, but the weather became unfavourable, and anchor was weighed
at 4.30 A.M. on February 7, as it was considered unadvisable to remain longer at anchor
in such an exposed position (for description of Heard Island, see Narr. Chall. Exp.,
vol. i. pp. 369-378).
Station 151 (Sounding 255), off Heard Island (see Chart 22).
STATION 151.
February 7, 1874 ; lat. 52° 59' 30" S., long. 73° 33' 30" E.
Temperature of air at noon, 37°:8; mean for the day, 36°:6.
Temperature of water at surface, 36º.2.
Density at 60° F. at surface 1.02515.
Depth, 75 fathoms ; deposit, Volcanic Sand, containing 2:58 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4 A.M. got up steam, and at 4.30 A.M. weighed anchor and proceeded out of
Corinthian Bay, Heard Island. Shaped course E. by N. for Shag Rock. At 7 A.M. stopped
and sounded in 75 fathoms near Shag Rock. At 7.30 A.M. put over dredge, which came
up at 8.45 A.M. containing many specimens. In these cold regions the bottom of the sea
seemed to be teeming with animal life. Proceeded N. W. by W., and at 9.50 A.M. sounded
in 60 fathoms. At 10.30 A.M. sounded in 75 fathoms. At 11.45 A.M. stopped engines,
made all plain sail, and proceeded, shaping course towards the South Pole in the track
