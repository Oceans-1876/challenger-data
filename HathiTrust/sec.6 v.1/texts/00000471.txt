Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02745.
Depth, 1650 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 48-61 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 10 A.M. shortened sail, stopped and sounded in 1650 fathoms. At 11.45 A.M.
completed sounding. Obtained a series of temperatures at intervals of 100 fathoms down
to 500 fathoms. At 4 P.M. observed land on starboard beam. At 5.45 P.M. shortened and
furled square sails, got up steam, and at 6 P.M. sounded in 22 fathoms. At 6.30 P.M.
proceeded under steam. Observed Pernambuco and Olinda lights on starboard beam.
At 9 P.M. altered course and sounded in 22 fathoms. At 10 P.M. sounded in 22 fathoms,
and at 10.30 P.m. lost sight of lights. At 11 P.M. sounded in 26 fathoms, and at mid-
night in 40 fathoms, no bottom. Sargassum floated by the ship in considerable
quantities, but not in patches.
Distance at noon from Pernambuco, 47 miles. Made good 65 miles. Amount of
current 20 miles, direction N. 37° W.

Temperature of air at noon, 79°:3 ; mean for the day, 77°•1.
Temperature of water at surface, 78°:0.

Depth, 675 fathoms; deposit, Red Mud, containing 38.93 per cent. of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.40 A.M. stopped and sounded in 675 fathoms (Station 120). At 5.20 A.M.
proceeded S.S.W. At 6 A.M. stopped, put dredge over, and lowered cutter to try current,
which was found to be N.N.W. į mile per hour. At 10 A.m. hove up dredge with some
specimens, and put over trawl. At 1.30 P.m. hove up trawl which contained various
