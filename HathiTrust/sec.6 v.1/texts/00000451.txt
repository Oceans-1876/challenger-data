Depth, 1500 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 80:47 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 10.30 A.m. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to trawl and sound.
Put trawl over, and veered 2000 fathoms. Lowered cutter to try current. At 12.30 P.M.
sounded in 1500 fathoms. At 3.30 P.M. cutter returned ; found current running W.N. W. at
the rate of 1} miles per hour. At 4 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up
at 5.30 P.M. with several specimens. The carbonic acid was determined in water from
50 fathoms, and amounted to 53:3 milligrammes per litre. At 5.40 P.m. made sail,
and proceeded towards St. Paul's Rocks.
Distance at noon from St. Paul's Rocks, 169 miles. Made good 132 miles. Amount
of current 21 miles, direction N. 84º W.
