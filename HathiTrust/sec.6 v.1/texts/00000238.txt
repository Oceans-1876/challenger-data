STATION 3.
;
Station 3 (Sounding 47), Tenerife to Sombrero (see Chart 6 and Diagram 1).
February 18, 1873 ; lat. 25° 45' N., long. 20° 14' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 67°:8; mean for the day, 66°:6.
Temperature of water at surface, 65°:0; bottom, 37°•0.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02719.
Depth, 1525 fathoms ; deposit, Pteropod Ooze, containing about 70 per cent. of
carbonate of lime, manganese concretions, and dead fragments of Coral coated
with manganese (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall, Exp.).
At 9 A.M. sounded in 1525 fathoms, but the machine brought up no bottom ; sounded
again in 1530 fathoms with a similar result. At 10 A.M. lowered dredge with 2 cwt. at
300 fathoms from it, and with 2200 fathoms of line. At 1 P.M. boats went away
to pick up surface animals, and returned at 4 P.M., when the trawl was put over. At

was obtained from the basal portions of the large Sponges. At 7 P.m. hauled in the trawl.
