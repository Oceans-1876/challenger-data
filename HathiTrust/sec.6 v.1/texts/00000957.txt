Depth, 2150 fathoms ; deposit, Volcanic Mud, containing no carbonate of lime
(see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound. At
10 A.M. sounded in 2150 fathoms. At 11 A.m. put over trawl. At 1 P.M. obtained
serial temperatures down to 800 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water
from 800 fathoms, and amounted to 39.7 milligrammes per litre. At 6.45 P.M. trawl
came up with a number of specimens, pieces of volcanic conglomerate, several palm fruits,
and pieces of wood and bark. The mud also contained a large number of oval arenaceous
bodies, believed to be the dung of Echinoderms. The wind having fallen almost to a
calm, proceeded under steam for the remainder of the day.
Distance at noon from Sibago Island, 274 miles. Made good 61 miles. Amount of
current 16 miles, direction N. 68° W.
