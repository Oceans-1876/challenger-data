SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

Station 108 (Sounding 179), St. Vincent to St. Paul's Rocks (see Chart 12 and Station 108.
Diagram 4).
August 27, 1873 ; lat. 1° 10' N., long. 28° 23' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 80°:0; mean for the day, 77°•6.
Temperature of water at surface, 78°:0; bottom, 36°:8.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02641.
Depth, 1900 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 84.90 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound.
At 7 A.M.
sounded in 1900 fathoms. At 8.20 A. M. completed sounding, and made sail. At 2 P.M.
observed St. Paul's Rocks to W.S.W.—a group of low rocks, apparently barely
projecting above the surface of the ocean. The two most prominent rocks are not more
than between 60 and 70 feet high. Got up steam, and at 2.15 P.M. proceeded under
steam. At 3.45 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and at 4 P.M. stopped to leeward of
St. Paul's Rocks. Lowered cutter and jolly-boat, and sent officers and members of
civilian scientific staff on shore to examine rocks. At 5 P.m. secured ship with hawser
to the point on N.E. side of cove, at three-quarter hawser length, the ship's bow
being then in 104 fathoms.
Distance at noon from St. Paul's Rocks, 37 miles. Made good 133 miles. Amount of
current 39 miles, direction N. 79° W.

Moseley writes : “ Two large specimens of Albacore, 60 or 70 lbs. in weight, were
