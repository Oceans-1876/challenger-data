8.45 A. M stopped off Nightingale Island. Landed exploring and surveying parties. At
9 A.M. proceeded on a sounding and dredging cruise round Nightingale Island. Between
4 and 6 P.M. two hauls of the dredge were taken in depths of 150 to 100 fathoms,
Coarse Shelly Bottom, containing 96.00 per cent. of carbonate of lime (Station 135c).
A large number of specimens of all groups were obtained. A sounding was also taken in
72 fathoms, Coarse Shelly Bottom (Station 135D). At 6.15 P.m. surveying and exploring
