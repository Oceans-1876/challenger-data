STATION 46.
Station 46 (Sounding 104), Bermuda to Halifax (see Chart 9).
May 6, 1873 ; lat. 40° 17' N., long. 66° 48' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 47°:2; mean for the day, 45°:0.
Temperature of water at surface, 40°:0; bottom, 37°-2.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02403.
Depth, 1350 fathoms ; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 15.40 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. proceeded under steam to sound. At 9 A.M. sounded in 1350 fathoms.
At 11 A.M. put over dredge, which came up at 4 P.M. with a small quantity of mud and several
specimens. The dredge was sent down again about 4 P.M., and brought up about 6.30 P.M.,
but it did not seem to have reached the bottom, the ship having possibly drifted into
deeper water. There was a brilliant halo round the sun during a part of the day, showing
prismatic colours. Many petrels and flocks of other birds were observed from the ship.
