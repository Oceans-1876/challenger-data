At daylight observed Mindanao Island on starboard bow. At 9.15 A.M. stopped and Station 202.
sounded in 2550 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to 600 fathoms. At
noon completed observations and proceeded under steam. A large flock of white and
brown birds (boobies and gannets) approached the ship while sounding.
Distance at noon from Point Binigsian, the west extremity of Negros Island,
83 miles. Made good 92 miles. Amount of current 6 miles, direction N. 31° E.

In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books from the tow-nets at the
surface and down to a depth of 50 fathoms :-Peridinium, a few Oscillatoriaceæ
(Spirillum), Diatoms, Globigerina, Orbulina, and Pulvinulina—the most abundant
form being Globigerina æquilateralis, hitherto rare—Radiolaria, Medusæ, Echinoderm
larvæ, Pluteus, Sagitta, Planarian, Polynoë, Sabellid larvæ, Aphroditacean larvæ, larvæ
of Balanoglossus, Cypridina, Pachysoma punctatum, Saphirina, Corycæus, and other
Copepods, Hyperia, Lucifer, Zoëæ (including the Zoëa elaphoceras of Dohrn), Nauplii,
Pterotrachea (?), Macgillivraya, Pteropods and larvæ, small cuttle-fish, Appendicularia,
and several small fishes. A piece of sea-weed (like Sargassum) was picked up on
October 28, at some distance from the land.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “ We found at the surface, for the first time, a queer little
Copepod described by Claus under the name of Pachysoma, which very well expresses
the shape of its body. It is a Corycæid allied to Copilia, from which it differs by the
absence of lenses and the presence of only a simple median eye.”
The Challenger anchored at Ilo-Ilo at 5 P.M. on October 28, remaining there till At ILo-Ilo.
