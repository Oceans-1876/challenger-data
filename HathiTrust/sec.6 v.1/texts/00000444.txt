those strange organs protuded by certain caterpillars from the head, and by the beetle-
genus Staphylinus from the tail. Fritillaria was also present to-day. This remarkable
genus of Appendicularians was first found at Messina by Fol; it has a very elongated
transparent body, in which testis and ovary are well separated from each other and from
the digestive and branchial apparatus, so that from this genus a good view of the
complicated anatomy of Appendicularia can be easily obtained.”

carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and trawl. At
9 A.M. put trawl over. At 9.20 A.M. brought ship to wind, and sounded in 2500 fathoms.

tures down to 1500 fathoms. At 5.30 P.M. trawl came up with several specimens.
