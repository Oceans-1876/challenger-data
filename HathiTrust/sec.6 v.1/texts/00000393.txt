At 9.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound and dredge. At
10 A.M. sounded in 1000 fathoms, and at 11 A.M. put dredge over, veering 1500 fathoms.
Took serial temperatures down to 300 fathoms. At 3 P.M. dredge came up about three-
quarters full of mud, and with many specimens. At 3.15 P.M. made all plain sail. At
4.20 P.m. observed Formigas Rocks on port bow. At 8.15 P.M. threw overboard one of
Hohn's patent lights for experiment, and observed its light for 18 minutes.
