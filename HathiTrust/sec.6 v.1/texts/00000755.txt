The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the dredge at this Animals FROM
Station :
DREDGE.
OPHIUROIDEA (Lyman, Zool. pt. 14).
Ophioglypha ornata, n.sp. Obtained also at Station 216, 2000 fathoms.
sp. (?).
Ophiomastus tegulitius, n.g., n.sp. Obtained also at Stations 164, 166, and 218,
275 to 2600 fathoms.
MACRURA (Spence Bate, Zool. pt. 52).
Pontophilus profundus, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
In addition, the Station-book records :—Silicisponge, Pennatulid, worm-tubes, and
Polyzoa.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The dredge brought up a small Crangonid of a tribe
which has not often been taken in the deep-sea ; I remember only one instance of having
found them on the coast of Brazil. The candelabriform Polyzoon taken to-day seems
to be closely allied to the form so frequently obtained in the tropical parts of the
Atlantic. The worm-tubes were empty.”
