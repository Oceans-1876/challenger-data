Many flying fishes (Ecocoetus) and a shark were seen ; a tow-net was carried away
by a shark.
About a dozen each of Pyrocystis noctiluca and Pyrocystis fusiformis were carefully
separated from other things and placed in two globes, each globe containing only the
same variety, and after dark were examined for phosphorescence. When the water was
disturbed several very brilliant spots of light appeared in both globes, and no difference
in the nature or intensity of the light could be detected. They lost their light more or
less after being disturbed several times in succession, but when allowed to rest for an
hour or so they were again as bright as at first.
