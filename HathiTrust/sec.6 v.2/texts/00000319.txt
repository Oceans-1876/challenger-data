Depth, 2350 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing 28-28 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.m. shortened and furled sails, proceeded under steam, and sounded in
2350 fathoms. The sounding-tube contained about a litre of the deposit ; in the lower
part of the tube it was of a dark red or chocolate colour, and contained many crystals of
phillipsite, manganese grains, and volcanic minerals, but no carbonate of lime organisms
and very few Radiolaria, in short was quite like the deposit at the previous Station.
On this occasion the deposit was extracted from the tube in a long continuous
roll, and a good idea could be formed of the arrangement of the deposit, which,
proceeding upwards from the dark chocolate clay referred to, became lighter and
lighter in colour, and pari passu with the lighter colour the calcareous organisms in the
form of Globigerina and other Foraminifera increased in number till at the top of the
tube there was a light grey coloured ooze containing over 30 per cent. of carbonate of
lime ; the transition from the Red Clay at the bottom to the calcareous ooze at the top
was quite gradual. At 7.30 A.M. put trawl over and veered 2500 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. At 12.15 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl.
Sent whaler away with naturalist for surface collecting. At 4.15 P. M. trawl came up
with a large quantity of Red Clay, about half a ton of manganese nodules, small pieces of
pumice, angular basaltic pebbles, many sharks' teeth, and a few animals. The tow-nets
at the trawl were quite full of the deposit, in the siftings of which were found many
