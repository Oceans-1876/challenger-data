THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER,
STATION 257.
At 11 A.M. got up steam.
At 11.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At noon
proceeded under steam. At 1 P.M. sounded in 2875 fathoms. The valves of the
sounding-tube had become jammed, and consequently did not open on reaching the
bottom, but the tube had sunk two feet into the deposit and was streaked with clay,
and sufficient was scraped off to indicate the nature of the deposit. Obtained serial
temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. At 4 P.M. completed temperatures, and at
4.15 P.M. made all plain sail. Albatrosses became less numerous; one was caught.
Several boatswain birds were seen flying high.
East point of Oahu Island, Sandwich Islands, distant at noon, 402 miles. Made
good 89 miles. Amount of current 15 miles, direction S. 45° W.

Most of the organisms noted at the previous Station were taken at the surface ;
Hastigerina was not, however, noticed. A haul of the tow-net from 500 fathoms
brought up Globigerina, Orbulina, Fulvinulina, Phæodaria and other Radiolaria not
usually observed at the surface, many specimens of Cypridina, Euphausia, and Sergestes,
as well as masses of Diatoms apparently different from those previously seen on the high
seas, Pyrocystis, Peridinium, and small Infusoria. Many of the specimens of Pyrocystis
were in a state of division, an outer sphere frequently containing two perfectly-separated
individuals.
