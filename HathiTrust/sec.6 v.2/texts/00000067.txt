A slight breeze sprang up before daybreak, and at 3.50 A.M. there was a squall
accompanied by rain and lightning. At 11 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded
under steam to sound. At noon sounded in 2050 fathoms. At 1.30 P. M. put over
trawl, veering 2700 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms.
The carbonic acid was determined in water from 50 fathoms, and amounted to
29-8 miligrammes per litre. At 5 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up
at 7.30 P.M. containing a few specimens and several hardened pieces of clay, in which
fragments of wood were imbedded. Proceeded under steam.
Balat Island distant at noon, 81 miles. Made good 26 miles. Amount of current
8 miles, direction S. 30° W.
