(Peridinium) tripos (very seldom in catena) and another species, and a number of
Infusoria, &c.

At 6 A. M. passed between Maestro de Campo and Banton Islands, steamed south of
Simara Island, and about 10 A.M. entered the strait between Tablas and Romblon
Islands. At 1.50 P.M. stopped and sounded in 700 fathoms. At 2 P.M. sent down trawl.
Obtained serial temperatures down to the bottom. The carbonic acid was determined
in surface water, and amounted to 37.2 milligrammes per litre. . At 5.45 P.M. trawl
came up with several specimens. Position of sounding and trawling about four
miles south of the sounding of 705 fathoms (Station 204) obtained on November 2,
1874, on the way north. At 6 P.M. made all plain sail.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the trawl at
