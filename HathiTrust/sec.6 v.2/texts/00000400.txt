At 2.20 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 3.15 P.M.
sounded in 1325 fathoms. Took serial temperatures down to the bottom. The carbonic
acid was determined in water from the surface and 100 fathoms, and amounted
respectively to 48:9 and 50:4 milligrammes per litre. At 5.40 P.M. completed observations
and made all plain sail. Diomedea exulans and stormy petrels were seen.
