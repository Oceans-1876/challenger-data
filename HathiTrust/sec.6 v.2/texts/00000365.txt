some of them being quite as large as any found in the deposits at the bottom. In a great Station 294.
many instances they were surrounded with yellow-coloured sarcode ; apparently this
expands in the form of a large float, but we have never been able to get a specimen fully
expanded as in the case of Hastigerina.

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02536; 1000 fathoms, 1·02563; bottom, 1.02562.
Depth, 1500 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze.
At 10 A.M. stopped. Put trawl over and veered 2500 fathoms. Sounded in
1500 fathoms. The sounding-tube contained some water, which on being allowed to settle
gave indications of a red-coloured Globigerina Ooze, but the tow-nets at the trawl
contained many fragments of augite-andesite, which may possibly have been derived from
a comparatively recent volcanic outflow at the bottom. Took serial temperatures from
surface to bottom. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom water, and amounted to
47.5 milligrammes per litre. At 3 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, having previously
shortened the line to 1900 fathoms. It came up at 4.30 P.M. containing only a fish, which
was still alive when taken out of the trawl. Made sail. Two specimens of Diomedea
exulans were caught from the ship, and two mutton birds were shot from a boat; there
were seen besides Procellaria maxima or Procellaria, gigantea, Procellaria capensis,
Prion turtur, Mother Carey's chickens, along with a molly mauk (?), Diomedea fuliginosa (?),
and a small black petrel with white belly.
