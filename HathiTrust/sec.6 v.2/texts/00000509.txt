Depth, 1415 fathoms; deposit, Pteropod Ooze, containing 95.61 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. got up steam. At 9.40 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceede:1
under steam to sound. At 10 A.M. sounded in 1415 fathoms. The sounding-tube sunk
ten inches into the bottom, and brought up over a litre of the ooze; many of the
Pteropod, Heteropod, and Foraminifera shells were coloured black or brown by the
oxides of manganese and iron. Took serial temperatures down to 1000 fathoms. The
carbonic acid was determined in water from 400 fathoms, and amounted to
43.6 milligrammes per litre. At 12.30 P. M. completed observations and made sail.
Ascension Island distant at noon, 570 miles ; St. Helena, 480 miles. Made good
134 miles. Amount of current 8 miles, direction S. 83° W.
