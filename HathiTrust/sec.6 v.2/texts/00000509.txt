of deposit; many of the Pteropod shells in the ooze were covered with a thin coating of
manganese. Took serial temperatures down to 1000 fathoms. The carbonic acid was
determined in water from 400 fathoms, and amounted to 44'1 milligrammes per litre.
At 5.45 P.M. completed temperatures and made sail.
