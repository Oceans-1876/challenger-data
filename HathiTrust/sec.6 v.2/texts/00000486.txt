STATION 328.
Station 328 (Sounding 478), Rio de la Plata to Tristan da Cunha (see Chart 16
and Diagram 6).
March 6, 1876 ; lat. 37° 38' S., long. 39° 36' W.
Temperature of air at noon, 65°:8; mean for the day, 62°:9.
Temperature of water at surface, 68°:0; bottom, 32°:9.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02571.
Depth, 2900 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing no carbonate of lime (see
Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 11.10 A.m. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound.
At 1 P.M. sounded in 2900 fathoms. The sounding-tube brought up over a litre of the
clay, of which the upper layers were slightly darker than the lower. On account of the
heavy sea no temperature observations were attempted. At 2 P.M. completed sounding
