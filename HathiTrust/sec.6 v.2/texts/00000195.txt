SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

At 2.45 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 4.30 A.M. put over trawl, veering Station 243.
3500 fathoms. At 6 A.m. brought ship to wind and sounded in 2800 fathoms. No
sample of the deposit was obtained, but on allowing the water from the water-bottle to
settle slight indications of Red Clay were obtained. Took serial temperatures down to
1500 fathoms. At 11 A.M. the trawl-rope parted close to one of the blocks on the
forecastle. At 2 P.M. put over deep-sea tow-nets, one attached to the end of the line,
two 250 fathoms from the end, and two 1200 fathoms from the end; about 3000 fathoms
of line were veered, but the lead did not touch the bottom. All the nets, except the
bottom one, came up foul of the line, but contained a number of Phæodaria. At 5 P.M.
made sail. Albatrosses, boatswain birds, and stormy petrels were seen about the ship.
Distance at noon from Honolulu, 2048 miles. Made good 100 miles. Amount of
current 16 miles, direction N. 35° E.
