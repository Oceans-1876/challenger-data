The great majority of these genera are represented by a single species, while there
are 3 with two species, 2 with three species, and 2 with four species.
Notes on the Geographical Distribution.-Of the 4250 species enumerated in the
above list, 1472 species (or 35 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 2392
species (or 56 per cent.) were taken within the tropics, and 571 species (or 13 per cent.)
were taken north of the northern tropic; while 26 species (or 0:6 per cent.) were found
to be common to all those three areas, 31 species (or 0-7 per cent.) were common to the
southern and northern areas, 94 species (or 2 per cent.) were common to the southern
and tropical areas, and 88 species (or 2 per cent.) were common to the tropical and
northern areas. In addition, there are eleven species, the habitats of which are unknown.
The bathymetrical and geographical information in the foregoing lists is presented
in tabular form on page 1430, excluding the Meduse and Siphonophoræ and other species
possibly captured in the intermediate or surface waters, so that these numbers are
believed to include only benthonic species.
1 The number of species is indicated in parentheses for those genera containing more than one species.
