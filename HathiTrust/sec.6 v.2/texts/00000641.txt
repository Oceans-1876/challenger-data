The majority of these genera are represented by a single species, but there are three
genera with two species, three genera with three species, and one genus with four
species, found only in this zone.
Notes on the Geographical Distribution.—An examination of the foregoing list
shows that of the 1893 species taken in this zone between 100 and 500 fathoms,
825 species (or 43 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 953 species
(or 50 per cent.) were taken within the tropics, and 360 species (or 19 per cent.)
were taken north of the northern tropic; while 40 species (or 2 per cent.) were found
to be common to all those three areas, 33 species (or 2 per cent.) were common
to the southern and northern areas, 77 species (or 4 per cent.) were common to the
southern and tropical areas, and 75 species (or 4 per cent.) were common to the
tropical and northern areas.
