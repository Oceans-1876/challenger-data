Depth, 2250 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay.
At 4.20 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 5 A.M. proceeded under steam, and at
5.30 A.M. sounded in 2250 fathoms. Inside the sounding-tube were two or three small
pellets of Red Clay. At 7.15 A.M. put trawl over. Took serial temperatures down to
1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from 1775 fathoms and
bottom, and amounted respectively to 42:3 and 464 milligrammes per litre. At
12.10 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 2.20 P.M. containing a few
specimens, and a small manganese nodule with egg-capsule attached. The leads and
ironwork of the trawl were covered in some places with streaks of the black peroxide of
manganese, as if they had been hauled over a bottom where manganese was abundant.
The following birds were noticed :-Diomedea exulans, Diomedea melanophrys, Prion
turtur, Procellaria capensis, mutton birds, black night-hawks, a white bird of the size of
the mutton bird, and a large black bird-probably either Diomedea fuliginosa or
Procellaria maxima.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 2310 miles. Made good 102 miles. Amount of current
11 miles, direction E.
