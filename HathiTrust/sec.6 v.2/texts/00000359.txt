ANIMALS FROM
TRAWL.
Depth, 2550 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing no carbonate of lime (see
Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam.
At 6 A.M.
sounded in 2550 fathoms. No trace of the bottom was found in the sounding-tube, nor
adhering to the outside. At 7 A.M. put trawl over and veered 3100 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom
water, and amounted to 47.4 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in
trawl, which came up at 3.20 P.M. containing several specimens, over a bushel of
manganese nodules, three large carbones of Cetaceans, fragments of bones, and two
sharks' teeth, all deeply embedded in manganese. At 3.30 P.M. made all plain sail. The
usual birds, as noted at the last two Stations, were about the ship.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 2907 miles. Made good 18 miles. Amount of current
7 miles, direction N. 7° W.
