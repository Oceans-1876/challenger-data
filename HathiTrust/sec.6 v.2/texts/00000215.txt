SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
969
ship to wind, and sounded in 2900 fathoms. At 8 A.M. veered trawl-rope to Station 248.
3700 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms.
At 2 P.M.
commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at 5 P.m. much torn, but containing
many manganese nodules, pumice-stones coated with manganese, sharks' teeth, and
a few specimens. At 5.30 P.m. made all plain sail. The carbonic acid was determined
in water from 400 and 2475 fathoms, and amounted respectively to 39.2 and
35.3 milligrammes per litre. Black albatrosses were numerous about the ship, and
were easily taken with the hook ; boatswain birds and prion-like birds were also seen.
Honolulu distant at noon, 1405 miles. Made good 98 miles. Amount of current
for the last two days 35 miles, direction N. 75º E.

Excluding Protozoa, about a dozen specimens of invertebrates were obtained at
this Station, belonging to 7 species, of which 3 are new to science, including
representatives of 2 new genera; 1 of the new species was not obtained elsewhere.
