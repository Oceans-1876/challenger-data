sented. The Diagranis show the isotherms for every five degrees, which were obtained by plotting the
temperature observations on paper of equal squares and drawing the curves (the observations and curves
are published as Part III. of the Physics and Chemistry of the Expedition).
In the Diagrams the thick Horizontal lines represent lines of equal temperature in Fahrenheit

Scale,
The figures above each Vertical line, thus,

the number of the
Station, 68, the Surface Temperature, and, 2650, the Depth in fathoms. The figures below
each Vertical line indicate the temperature at the Bottom, the type of Deposit being
given with the percentage of Carbonate of Lime underneath.
