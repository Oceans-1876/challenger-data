THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
COLLECTIONS
FROM TOW-NETS.
submitted to a microscopic examination by the naturalists. Notes concerning these
collections were always entered in the journals stating the general character of the fauna
and flora, along with particulars about rare or unusual occurrences. Many hundreds of
microscopic preparations of these pelagic organisms were mounted in various preserving
mediums. The reports of Professor Haeckel and Mr Brady concerning the pelagic
Radiolaria and Foraminifera were largely based upon the microscopic preparations thus
mounted during the voyage by Mr Murray. Samples of these tow-net gatherings were
also preserved in spirit, but no systematic attempt was made to form complete collections
of pelagic organisms representing each region of the ocean visited by the Expedition.
To have preserved all the collections from the surface waters would have been beyond
the resources at our command. Even those collections of pelagic organisms that were
brought home were so large that they have not yet all been carefully examined by
specialists.
When we remember all the varied researches in which the Expedition was engaged,
the wonder is that so much was accomplished, rather than that some fields of investigation
were only partially explored.
