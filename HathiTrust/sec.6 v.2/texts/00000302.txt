In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Ethmodiscus and other
Diatoms, Pyrocystis noctiluca and Pyrocystis fusiformis, Peridinium, Globigerina,
Orbulina, Hastigerina, Pullenia, Sphæroidina, Pulvinulina, Hydroids on Pteropod
shells, Echinoderm larva, Sagitta, Aphroditacean and other Annelid larvæ, Calanids,
Saphirina, and other Copepods, Hyperids, Oxycephalus, Euphausia, Lucifer,
Sergestes, Zoöæ, Tiedemannia [= Gleba] and other Pteropods, Appendicularia,
Doliolum. A net sent down to 200 fathoms brought up a few Challengeridæ and many
other Radiolaria, along with some very large living Foraminifera, while the tow-net at
the weights contained a few Challengerida and other deep-water things, a small Scopelid,
and a young Sternoptyx. Several sharks and many flying fishes were seen.
In one of the Phæodaria (Conchopsis) the pseudopodia were seen to ramify through
the brownish matter of the phæodium. Some of the Foraminifera shells (Globigerina)
were filled with zoospores. Most of the Pullenia were surrounded by a great mass of
yellow sarcode, completely obscuring the shells.
