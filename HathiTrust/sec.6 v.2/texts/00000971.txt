wards, the rate of propagation being so slight as to be regarded rather as a slow creep than
as a distinctly recognisable movement of the water. It is evident that the increase of
temperature from the bottom of the ocean to the surface is due to the slow descent of
the warmer water of the surface carrying downwards their higher temperature to
greater depths.
The following mean temperatures, calculated from the whole of the observations in
all latitudes for the different depths, show the rate of diminution of the temperature
downwards :-

Thus the fall of temperature from 100 fathoms to 2200 fathoms is 259:5, and of
this there is a fall of 10'6 from 100 to 200 fathoms. For each successive 100 fathoms
the falls of temperature are 5º4, 2°:9, 1°:7, 1°:1, 09:9, 0°:8, 09:5, 0°:3, 0°:4, 0°:3, 0°:2,
0°-2, and 0°1, and for the 700 fathoms from 1500 to 2200 fathoms the mean fall is
only the tenth of a degree.

PREVAILING WINDS OVER THE OCEAN.
These will be best studied in detail by referring to the Report on Atmospheric
Circulation, pp. 48–69, and the maps, 27–52, which show the isobaric lines and prevail-
ing winds of the globe for the months and the year. In these maps the general
movement of the atmosphere over the different oceans through the months of the year
is clearly shown. The outstanding features of the circulation of the atmosphere bearing
on this discussion will be seen in an examination of the prevailing winds in January
and July
January.--In the North Atlantic, north of about lat. 35° N, atmospheric circulation
is ruled by the low pressure about Iceland, in conjunction with the high pressure over
North America on the one hand and Eurasia on the other. From this geographical
distribution of the mass of the earth's atmosphere, it inevitably follows that over the
east coast of America the prevailing winds are north-westerly, and over Western Europe
south-westerly. Hence the prevailing winds at this season blow the surface waters of
