REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING STATION LISTS.
In the foregoing account of the scientific work carried out, and of the general results
obtained, at each of the Challenger observing stations at sea, no mention has been made
of a large number of observations recorded during the early part of the voyage in the
note books, as these had become obsolete in the light of subsequent knowledge acquired
during the cruise. Could the various problems regarding oceanic phenomena have been
viewed through the experience gained during the voyage and subsequently, many of the
preceding descriptions would certainly have been much more complete, for fuller details
might frequently have been furnished concerning many matters which did not at the
time appear of great importance.
It must be remembered that the exploration of the deep sea was in its infancy at PreliminARY
the outset of the Expedition. The work was almost entirely new to the naval officers Work on Board
THE CHALLENGER,
and the members of the civilian staff. It took several months to test the various
appliances and instruments, to settle the methods of observation, to arrange the best way
of recording the different results, and to apportion the work among the members of the
scientific staff. As time went on, the proceedings of the ship, and the operations on
