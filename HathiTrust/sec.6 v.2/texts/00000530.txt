THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 348.
The tow-nets at the surface and down to 200 fathoms yielded an abundant harvest,
including :—Many Oscillatoriaceæ, Peridinium, Pyrocystis, Diatoms, Globigerina,
Orbulina, Hastigerina, Pullenia, Sphæroidina, Pulvinulina, Acanthometræ, Polycystinæ,
Challengeridæ, and compound Radiolaria, Medusæ, Siphonophoræ, Echinoderm larvæ
(Bipinnaria), Sagitta, Alciopa, Tomopteris, Distomum parasitic on Sagitta, Cypridina,
various Copepods, Hyperids, Rhabdosoma, Lucifer, Gasteropod shells, Atlanta, Acura
pelagica, various Pteropods, larvæ of Cymbulia (?) and Pleuropus [ = Cavolinia),
Appendicularia, Doliolum, and larval fishes. The sarcode of a large number of
Sphæroidina was carefully examined, and frequently there were observed in the interior
of the shells two large cells, some of them with a coarse granular appearance and others
very much more minutely granular, but no conclusion was arrived at concerning their
function or origin. Several sharks were about the ship, with suckers and pilot fishes,
and two were caught.
