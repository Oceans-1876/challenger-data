THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 234.
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.-
The following species are recorded from the surface at this
Station
RADIOLARIA (Haeckel, Zool. pt. 40).
Auloceros furcosus, Haeckel.
Heliosphæra castanella, Haeckel.
Sagoplegma pyramidophora, Haeckel.
Sethoconus trochus, Haeckel.
Medusetta quadrigata, Haeckel.
Castanissa crosbiei, Haeckel.
Theocampe cryptoprora, Haeckel.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books from the surface and down
to a depth of 60 fathoms :- Very many Noctiluca at the surface, nearly all with prey inside
and more or less collapsed, unlike in this respect the quite spherical specimens taken
while at anchor at Oosima ; Noctiluca was less abundant in the deep haul; Pyrocystis,
very few at the surface, more abundant in deep haul; Peridinium tripos (in catena) and
another species ; Diatoms (Coscinodiscus, &c.); Globigerina, Orbulina, Hastigerina ;
Vorticella (on Diatoms) and other Infusoria ; Medusæ, Siphonophoræ, Ophiurid larvæ,
Sagitta, Annelid larvæ, Planarian larvæ, Daphnia, Cypridina, Setella, Calanids, and
other Copepods, Phronimids, Euphausia, Incifer, Crustacean and other eggs, Zoëæ, small
Gasteropods and Lamellibranchs, Atlanta, Pteropods and larvæ, Appendicularia,
Doliolum. The hauls from the surface appeared to indicate a mixture of shallow-water
(neritic) and pelagic organisms, and the presence probably of brackish water, while the
deeper haul was much more oceanic in character.

and sounded in 565 fathoms. Put over trawl, which came up at 7.30 P.M. with many
