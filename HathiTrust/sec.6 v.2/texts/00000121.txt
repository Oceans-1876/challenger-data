Depth, 2475 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4 A.M. got up steam. At 5.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under
steam to sound. At 6.30 A.M. sounded in 2475 fathoms. Took serial temperatures down
to 1500 fathoms. At 10 A.M. completed observations and made sail. Albatrosses,
boatswain birds, and what seemed to be a noddy tern were seen about the ship.
No Sima lighthouse distant at noon, 1040 miles; Lindsay Islands, 105 miles.
Made good 77 miles. Amount of current 23 miles, direction N. 48° W.
Surface Organisms.— The following species are recorded from the surface in the ORGANISMS FROM
vicinity of this Station :-
SURFACE-NETS.
AMPHIPODA (Stebbing, Zool. pt. 67).
MACRURA (Spence Bate, Zool. pt. 52).
Phronima megalodous, n.sp.
Eretmocaris longicaulis, n.g., n.sp.
NUDIBRANCHIATA (Bergh, Zool. pt. 26).
Acura lanceolata, Bergh.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Oscillatoriaceæ,
Pyrocystis (two species), Ethmodiscus and other Diatoms, Peridinium tripos and two
other species, Gregarinids (Gregarina clavata ?), Globigerina, Orbulina, Pulvinulina,
Radiolaria in great numbers, Medusæ, Siphonophoræ, Beroë, Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta,
Alciopa, Sipunculid and Echiurid larvæ, Cypridina (several species), Setella, Copilia,
Calanids, Hyperids, Oxycephalus, Squilla larvæ, Euphausia, Siriella, Sergestes and
larvæ, Lucifer, Amphion, Phyllosoma, small Anomurous crab, Zoëæ of crab, Halobates,
small Lamellibranchs and Gasteropods, Atlanta, Pterotrachea, Hyalæa [ = Cavolinia),
Styliola, small Octopus, Fritillaria, Doliolum, Salpa, small Percoid fishes. Coccoliths
and Rhabdoliths were found in the stomachs of the Salpæ. About a dozen of the large
cylindrical Diatoms (Ethmodiscus) were separated into a globe of water, and after dark
disturbed for phosphorescence, but they showed no light. Coryphæna and another large
fish of a dark colour, with the dorsal and anal fins opposite each other on the hinder part
of the body, as well as a shoal of small fishes, were seen about the ship. In this
connection it may be noted that no sharks were seen, and it was observed that other
fishes were seldom seen when sharks were about.
