THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 208.
Retepora, and another Polyzoon spreading over Pinna and other shells, were present,
along with compound Ascidians. Crabs, Alpheus (mostly in Sponges), and small
Galathea were common. There were also many shells, especially Murex and Pecten,
the latter very large and fine.”
The stomachs of the Holothurians contained a greenish mass composed of pieces of
broken shells, Echini spines, and many varieties of shallow-water Foraminifera.
AT ZEBU.
The Challenger remained at Zebu from 1.30 P.M. on January 18 till 4 P.M. on
January 24, 1875. During this time dredgings were taken from the steam pinnace and
from the ship on the Euplectella-ground in 85 and 95 fathoms (see Station 209).
ORGANISMS FROM
SURFACE-NETS.
Surface Organisms.—While at anchor at Zebu the tow-net procured :-Diatoms,
two shore forms of Foraminifera, small Acanthometræ, Medusæ, Diphyes, Ctenophoræ,
Tomopteris, Copepods, Amphipods, larval Lamellibranchs and Gasteropods, and
Appendicularia.
STATION 209.
Station 209 (Sounding 345), Manila to Samboangan (see Chart 31).
January 22, 1875; lat. 10° 14' N., long. 123° 54' E.
Temperature of air at noon, 81°:3 ; mean for the day, 79°:3.
Temperature of water at surface, 81°:0; bottom, 71°:0.
Depth, 95 fathoms; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 35.82 per cent of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 7 A.M. got up steam. At 9 A.M. weighed anchor and proceeded out of Zebu Harbour
through the south channel with a party of visitors on board, and the steam pinnace in
company. At 10 A.M. stopped and put dredge over in 95 fathoms, off the S. entrance
of channel between Zebu and Mactan Islands, on the Euplectella-ground. In the course
of the day the big dredge was lowered five or six times in depths varying from 95 to
100 fathoms, many specimens being obtained. At 3 P.M. completed dredging, and at
4.15 P. M. returned to the anchorage in Zebu Harbour.
