SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
817
STATION 211.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02571; bottom, 1.02546.
Depth, 2225 fathoms; deposit, Blue Mud, containing 14.63 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. shortened and furled sail, and proceeded under steam. At 9 A.M. sounded
in 2225 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to 400 fathoms. The carbonic
acid was determined in bottom water, and amounted to 24:3 milligrammes per
litre. Position of sounding about 31 miles due W. of Point Gooder (Mindanao),
and about 35 miles S.S. W. of Station 202. At 10.50 A.M. completed observations
and made all plain sail. A few boobies (Sula) were observed skimming over the
surface of the water.
Sangboys Island distant at noon, 64 miles. Made good 107 miles. Amount of
current 14 miles, direction S. 69° W.
Two Hexactinellid Sponges (Holascus ridleyi, n.g., n.sp., and Iyalonema gracile,
D.sp.) are recorded in error by Schulze (Zool. pt. 53) from this Station ; they probably
came from Station 271 (see Station 271).
