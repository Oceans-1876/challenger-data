proceeded. At 11.30 A.M. stopped opposite Middle Island, and landed surveying and
exploring parties. Sounded in 345 fathoms (Station 306a). Put over trawl. Obtained
serial temperatures down to 200 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water
from the bottom, and amounted to 45'1 milligrammes per litre. At 1.15 P.M. trawl
came up with many specimens. At 2 P.m. surveying and exploring parties returned.
