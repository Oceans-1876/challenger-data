Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02591 ; bottom, 1.02525.
Depth, 2775 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 1.30 P.M. got up steam to sound. At 2.35 P.M. shortened and furled sails,
proceeded under steam, and sounded in 2775 fathoms. Took serial temperatures down
to 1500 fathoms. At 6.15 P.M. completed temperatures and made sail. One albatross
was seen which proved to be the last in this section of the cruise ; these birds had been
observed in numbers ever since the departure from Japan. Several boatswain birds were
seen, and a turnstone (Strepsilas interpres) flew about the ship in an exhausted
condition.
East point of Oahu Island distant at noon, 328 miles. Made good 74 miles.
Amount of current 8 miles, direction S. 61º W.
Moseley writes, with reference to the birds observed in this part of the Pacific :-
“ From the time of leaving Japan up till July 21 we were accompanied by numerous
albatrosses, all apparently young birds of last year and all dark, with the exception of
the commencement of white about the head and neck. A few stray white-plumaged
birds were seen, but rarely. With these was a prion which, however, left us almost
directly we turned south. The albatrosses fed tamely round the ship, as many as
twenty-four being seen at a time. After July 21 they suddenly diminished in numbers,
and on the 22nd and 23rd only two or three stragglers were seen ; on the 24th they
were gone. Boatswain birds (Phæthon) were seen very far north and far from land
before we turned south ; they re-appeared when the albatrosses began to leave. A
Thalassidroma and large petrel or puffin also were seen.
Surface Organisms.—The following are recorded in the note-books from the surface ORGANISMS FROM
