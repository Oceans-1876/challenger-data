STATION 222.
Depth, 2450 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing 6.86 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5 A.M. got up steam. At 5.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under
steam. At 6 A.M. sounded in 2450 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures down to
1500 fathoms. The wind changed to a favourable quarter, and the trawling was post-
poned to a future day. At 9.40 A.M. completed temperatures and made all plain sail
northwards. Petrels (Puffinus opisthomelas), Tachypetes, and Phæthon were seen.
Distance at noon from Guam Island, 660 miles. Made good 69 miles. Amount of
current 28 miles, direction S. 84° W.
