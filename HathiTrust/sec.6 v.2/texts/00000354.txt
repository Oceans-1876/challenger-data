In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books from the tow-nets, two

Pulvinulina, large Meduse (Pelagia), Sagitta, Alciopa, Tomopteris, Cypridina,
Saphirina, Copilia, Hyperids, larvæ of Euphausia and other Decapods, Lucifer, small
shells, Atlanta, Pteropods (naked and shelled) and larvæ, Appendicularia, Doliolum,
and small Scopelids with phosphorescent dots and brilliant scales. The Medusa gave
off phosphorescence when touched, apparently from all parts of the body, and the eyes
of the Euphausiæ became very brilliantly phosphorescent now and then and also when
agitated. The specimens of Pulvinulina micheliniana were very numerous, and the
shells were surrounded by a yellowish-green coloured mass of granular protoplasm. The
protoplasmic matter within the shell coloured deeply with carmine. Mixed with the
protoplasm surrounding the shells were numerous Coccospheres, Rhabdospheres, and
Diatoms.
