At 4.35 A.M. stopped and sounded in 3125 fathoms. At 6 A.M. put over small dredge
with swabs and tow-nets at the dredge and weights. At 9 A.M. obtained serial
temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from
400, 800, 2990, and 3090 fathoms, and amounted respectively to 39.7, 23.8, 25:5,
30:1 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.m. commenced heaving in dredge, which came up
at 4.40 P.M. with some manganese nodules and a few specimens, and the tow-nets also
contained some deposit and manganese nodules. One of the nodules measured
12 x 8 x 2 inches, and had on its upper surface attached Foraminifera, Serpula-tubes,
four specimens of Stephanoscyphus, Polyzoa, Ascidians, while to the under surface some
Annelids were attached. At 5 P.M. proceeded under steam. Albatrosses continued to
