shells, Glaucus, Doliolum, Salpa, Appendicularia. The ship passed through red and
white-coloured patches of water, and about the same time a great change was noticed
in the temperature of the surface water, which fell from 22° to 18° C. ; the patches
were so noticeable that the hand lead was cast to see if there were not a shoal. The
discoloration seemed to be due to Copepods, some of which were of a bright red colour,
similar to what was observed in the Southern Indian Ocean, while others belonging to
a different species were quite pale, and many of them dead.
Willemoes-Suhm writes: “The surface abounded with Hyperia, as on the passage
from Bermuda to Halifax. I found a minute Zoëa, notable for the insertion of the
eyes
deeply into the carapace, which has been figured by Dohrn from the Indian Ocean ; after
a careful search I failed to find any further specimens.”

Strong southerly breeze during the night and early morning. At 3 A.M. shortened
sail, and at 4 A. M. put over trawl with two tow-nets attached. When about 1900 fathoms
had been veered, the trawl-rope fouled the screw and parted, the trawl and line
being lost. In the evening it became calm and many Copepods and specimens of
Doliolum were obtained in the surface-nets.
