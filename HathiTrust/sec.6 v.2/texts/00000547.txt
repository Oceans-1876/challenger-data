The tow-nets procured :-Pyrocystis, Orbulina, compound Radiolaria, Medusa
(Discophora?), Diphyes, Physalia, and other Siphonophoræ, Sagitta, Cypridina,
Hyperids, Phronimids, Oxycephalus, Isopods, Euphausia, Sergestes, Amphion, Atlanta,
Pteropods, small Cephalopods, Salpa (with Coccospheres, young Foraminifera,
Peridinium and Pyrocystis, in the stomachs), and small fishes. Patches of water of a
very green colour were passed through on the 13th and 14th, the colour being apparently
due to immense numbers of minute spherical organisms (Infusoria), many of them with
yellow-brown sarcode, which moved very rapidly across the field of the microscope, and
also to very many minute Protococci. The water was afterwards of a clear blue colour,
but on approaching the coast of Spain it again assumed a dark green colour.

Ar Vigo Bay.
The Challenger entered Vigo Bay at 2 P.M. on May 20, and left again at 2 P. M. on
May 21, proceeding thence to Portsmouth. The following species of Ostracoda were
observed in the mud brought up on the anchor from 11 fathoms in Vigo Bay :-
