Depth, 2350 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 85.42 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.40 A.M. shortened sail. At 6 A.M. stopped and sounded 2350 fathoms ; the
sounding-tube had sunk about a foot into the ooze, but with the exception of a few
streaks on the outside it brought up no deposit. At 8 A.M. put dredge over and veered
2900 fathoms. At 9.30 A.M. took serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The
carbonic acid was determined in water from 800 and 1875 fathoms, and amounted
respectively to 45.5 and 39.2 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in
dredge, which came up at 3.45 P.M., with the swabs foul of the mouth of the dredge,
but with several specimens attached to the swabs. In the dredge and attached tow-nets
were about five litres of the deposit. Proceeded under steam and sail. A bird, probably
a frigate bird, was seen while dredging.
Cape Verde distant at noon, 1062 miles. Made good 88 miles. Amount of current
29 miles, direction S. 72º W.
