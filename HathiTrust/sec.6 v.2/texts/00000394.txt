Depth, 1450 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 82:31 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 6 A.M. sounded in
1450 fathoms. At 7 A.M. put trawl over and veered 2000 fathoms. Obtained serial
temperatures down to bottom. The carbonic acid was determined in water from
200, 400, and 800 fathoms, and bottom, and amounted respectively to 47.3, 48•8, 53.2,
and 55.6 milligrammes per litre. . At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came
up at 4.15 P.M. with numerous specimens, about a peck of the ooze, in which were
numerous manganese nodules, some volcanic pebbles, and pieces of rock. At 4.30 P.M.
made all plain sail. Molly mauks, stinkers (Procellaria maxima), mutton birds, and
Cape pigeons were seen, and a molly mauk was shot, but a boat could not be lowered to
pick it up
Cape Tres Montes distant at noon 382 miles. Made good 100 miles. Amount of
current 10 miles, direction W.
