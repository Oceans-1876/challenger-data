THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 255.
Mr. Murray was away in a boat, and as it was quite calm he observed a number of
things on the surface. There were large masses of Diatoms united into balls or elongated
masses, the latter sometimes over six inches in length and two inches in diameter; they
were made up of two kinds of Diatoms, or two different stages of development.
Hastigerina was the most abundant thing on the surface, the specimens looking like
little red dots all over the surface, and in the tow-net presenting a red mass. One
specimen was taken in a small bottle, and on being placed under the microscope presented
a wonderful appearance. The spines were exceedingly long, tapering to a point, and
very
flexible at the extremities. Between the spines were many small spheres, the
pseudopodia running along the spines and occasionally leaving them. The spheres
retired on treatment with colouring solution or acid. The specimen with fully-extended
spheres floated, while those from the tow-net lay in a mass at the bottom of the globe;
all attempts to mount specimens with the spheres extended failed. There were many
compound Radiolaria, Velellæ with lanthinæ attached, many specimens of Halobates,
and in addition all the things mentioned at the previous Station, except that Lepas was
not noticed, nor any of its larval stages, which again indicated that the ship had passed
into a region of the ocean where the fauna was different. Several small pieces of pumice
were picked up, some of them covered with a brown-coloured Alga, or mould.
