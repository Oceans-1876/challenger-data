Depth, 2550 fathoms; deposit, Radiolarian Ooze, containing 20 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.30 A. M. stopped to sound and dredge. At 6 A. M. sounded in 2550 fathoms.
The high percentage of carbonate of lime at this depth is remarkable, and has only
been met with in tropical waters ; it is apparently connected with the large number
of calcareous organisms in the counter equatorial current. At 7 A.M. put over dredge
with tow-net attached and tow-net at the weights, and veered 3000 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom
water, and amounted to 32.8 milligrammes per litre. At 4 P. M. commenced heaving in
dredge. At 7 P.M. dredge came up foul, but the tow-nets contained a little mud and a
small fish and some red Crustaceans. Made sail. Boatswain birds, fulmars,
, gannets,
shearwaters, and land birds, like dotterels, were seen:
Distance at noon from Venus Point, Tahiti, 1410 miles. Made good 85 miles.
Amount of current 24 miles, direction S. 75º E.
