THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Notes on the Geographical Distribution.--Anexamination of the foregoing list shows
that of the 631 species taken in this zone between 500 and 1000 fathoms, 356 species
(or 56 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 282 species (or 45 per cent.) were
taken within the tropics, and 164 species (or 26 per cent.) were taken north of the
northern tropic; while 30 species (or 5 per cent.) were found to be common to all those
three areas, 23 species (or 4 per cent.) were common to the southern and northern areas,
57 species (or 9 per cent.) were common to the southern and tropical areas, and 32
species (or 5 per cent.) were common to the tropical and northern areas.

6. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN DEPTHS
BETWEEN 100 AND 500 FATHOMS.
The Challenger dredged or trawled at 40 Stations where the depth was between 100
and 500 fathoms, about 6000 specimens of invertebrates and fishes being procured,
belonging to about 2050 species and about 865 genera. The total number of species and
genera actually described and recorded in the Zoological Reports from the zone between
these depths amounts to 1893 species and 776 genera, of which 1296 species (or 68 per
cent.) and 168 genera (or 21 per cent.) are new to science, as shown in the following list.
Those species taken by the Challenger in this zone only (numbering 1408 species, or 74
per cent.) are indicated by an asterisk thus.* The geographical distribution of the
species is indicated by the heavy letters S, T, and N, used to denote that the species was
taken south of the tropic of Capricorn (S), between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer
(T), or north of the tropic of Cancer (N.)
