SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 220.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02580; 350 fathoms, 1:02551 ; bottom, 1.02560.
Depths, 1100 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 63-75 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam to sound. At 9.30 A.M.
stopped and sounded in 1100 fathoms, about 80 miles due N. of the N.E. extremity of
Admiralty Islands. At 11.30 A.M. put trawl over. At 1.30 P.M. obtained serial
temperatures down to the bottom. At 4 P.M. hove up trawl with some pumice-stones
and a few specimens. At 5.30 P.M. completed temperatures. Owing to strong surface
current drifting ship away from sounding-line, 200 fathoms were deducted from the
1300 fathoms run out, to allow for the angle of the line, but the temperature curve
seemed to indicate the actual depth to be about 1200 fathoms. At 6 P.M. made
all plain sail.
Distance at noon from Guam Island, 850 miles. Made good 82 miles. Amount of
current 22 miles, direction W.
