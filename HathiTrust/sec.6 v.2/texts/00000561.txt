SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
1283
cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 56 species (or 35 per cent.) were taken
within the tropics, and 73 species (or 45 per cent.) were taken north of the northern
tropic; while 18 species (or 11 per cent.) were found to be common to all those three
areas, 8 species (or 5 per cent.) were common to both the northern and southern areas,
5 species (or 3 per cent.) were common to both the southern and tropical areas, and 6
species (or 4 per cent.) were common to both the tropical and northern areas.
2. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN DEPTHS BETWEEN
2000 AND 2500 FATHOMS.
The Challenger dredged or trawled at 32 Stations where the depth was between 2000
and 2500 fathoms, about 820 specimens of invertebrates and fishes being procured,
belonging to about 340 species, representing about 250 genera. The total number of
species and genera actually described and recorded in the Zoological Reports from the
zone between these depths amounts to 262 species and 184 genera, of which 240 species
(or 92 per cent. of the total number of species recorded in the Reports) and 82 genera (or
per cent.) are new to science, as shown in the following list. Those species taken by
the Challenger in this zone only (numbering 165 species or 63 per cent.) are indicated by
an asterisk thus.* The geographical distribution of the species is indicated by the heavy
letters, S, T, and N, used to denote that the species was taken south of the tropic of
Capricorn (S), between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer (T), or north of the tropic of
Cancer (N).
