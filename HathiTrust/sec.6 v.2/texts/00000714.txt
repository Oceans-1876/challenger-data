THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
shallow zones the percentage of the species procured in these zones which pass through
several zones of depth is very low, while in the deeper zones the percentage of species
procured in these zones which pass through several zones of depth is rather high. These
facts are evidently to be accounted for by the changes in the physical conditions
which take place between the depths of 100 and 500 fathoms. When once animals
have accommodated themselves to deep-sea conditions there are few barriers to further
vertical or horizontal migration, hence the same species is often recorded in several of
the deeper zones. An examination of Table I. page 1430 shows that the percentage of
new species from the shallower zones, which extend into the deeper zones, is relatively
large. This is probably due to a large number of the Challenger's dredgings and
trawlings being in rather deep water within these zones and on muddy bottoms. In all
probability the deep sea was peopled by continuous migrations downwards and seawards
from about the mud-line. If we suppose these migrations to have taken place from
the mud-line at many different periods of time and from many different parts of the
world, then it may be thus possible to account for the relatively large number of genera
in the deep sea in proportion to the number of species.

When we take into consideration the horizontal as well as the vertical distribution,
it would appear that in all the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the ocean the number of
individuals and species living on the sea-bed very distinctly diminishes with the distance
from the shore, and especially with the distance from continental shores. This statement
would be universally true for all regions of the ocean were not the continental conditions
pushed far from land by the presence of floating ice in the great Southern Ocean, and
in some similar regions of the northern hemisphere. At first sight it might appear that
this diminution in the number of species resulted from the greater depth at the seaward
stations. This cannot, however, be the sole explanation. When the captures at the same
or similar depths are compared from those stations within and those beyond 300 miles
from land, it is found that the near-shore stations yield much the larger number of
specimens and species. Stations in depths between 1000 and 2000 fathoms near shore
give, on the average, 121 specimens and 39 species per haul; the remote stations beyond
300 miles from land and between the same limits of depth yielded only 21 specimens and
10 species per haul. In making this comparison, those stations were selected in which
the conditions as to depth and other circumstances were nearly similar, excepting always
the distance from a continental shore.
When the results of the trawlings and dredgings on the different kinds of deposits
are compared, similar indications are obtained with reference to the relatively greater
abundance of both individuals and species close to continental shoresâ€”the Terrigenous
