Depth, 2950 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails.
At 4 A.M. got up steam.
At 4.40 A.M.
proceeded under steam, and at 5 A.M. sounded in 2950 fathoms. At 8 A.M. put small
dredge over with tow-nets attached at the weights and at the dredge. At 9 A.m. lowered
whaler with naturalist for surface collecting. Obtained serial temperatures down
to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from 2875 fathoms, and
amounted to 29.9 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge,
which came up at 5.30 P.M. with a large quantity of clay, a few
large quantity of clay, a few manganese nodules,
sharks' teeth, and pumice-stones. The tow-net at the dredge contained some mud, while
the tow-net at the weights had not touched the bottom and contained some intermediate
water organisms. Proceeded under steam. Albatrosses were still numerous ; one was
shot baving a piece of cotton bandkerchief round its neck, and one was caught and let go
again with a parchment label tied round its neck. Stormy petrels and boatswain birds
were also seen.
Honolulu distant at noon, 568 miles. Made good 41 miles. Amount of current
11 miles, direction N. 62° W.

Station :
ANIMALS FROM
DREDGE.

Ammoconia sagenella, n.g., n.sp. Obtained at no other locality.
LAMELLIBRANCHIATA (Smith, Zool. pt. 35).
Leda prolata, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
In the washings of the mud were a few worm-tubes and some arenaceous Foraminifera,
while a few specimens of Stephanoscyphus were attached to the nodules. Among the
nodules was one formed round the vertebra of a small Cetacean.
The following species of Foraminifera and Radiolaria were observed in the deposit
from this Station (see also Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.) :
