bottom. Indeed, those species which are captured in the trawl when it has been dragged
near, but has not touched, the bottom, or are captured in traps like those the Prince of
Monaco has used in deep water, have a much wider distribution than those species which
live in or fixed to the muds, clays, and oozes. It will thus be seen that in the
Stations close to each other the number of species common to two Stations is greater than
when the Stations are further removed from each other, but the larger percentage of
species common to the Stations in the high northern and high southern latitudes, than
between either of these and the equatorial Stations, is noteworthy, and seems to indicate
that a resemblance can be traced in deep water between the organisms of Arctic and
Antarctic regions. It must be admitted from these considerations that with reference
to species there is here no striking evidence of a universal deep-sea fauna spread
all over the floor of the ocean. The sanie groups of organisms recur, but this is also
true of animals living not deeper than the mud-line.
COMPARED WITH
Many of the deep-sea animals, especially those found in very deep water far from
land, present archaic characters. Discina and other Brachiopods undoubtedly represent
a very
ancient group The irregular Sea-urchins and siliceous Sponges recall the fossils
of the chalk. Still it must be admitted that those who expected to find in the deep sea
remnants of faunas which flourished in very remote geological periods have been much
disappointed. Heliopora, the King-crabs, Lingulas, Trigonias, Amphioxus, Sturgeons, Antiquity of tue

Sir Wyville Thomson was of opinion that, from the Silurian period to the FAUNAS
present day, there had been, as now, a continuous deep ocean with a bottom tempera-
ture oscillating about the freezing-point, and that there had always been an abyssal
fauna. I am rather inclined to think that in Paleozoic times the ocean basins were
not so deep as at the present time, that the ocean then had throughout a nearly
uniform high temperature, and that life was then either absent or represented only by
bacteria and other low forms in great depths, as appears to be the case at present in
the Black Sea. As in the Black Sea now, so also was there in all likelihood in
Pal√¶ozoic times insufficient oxygen in deep water to support a deep-sea fauna. From
many considerations, one is led to suggest that cooling at the poles commenced in early
Mesozoic times, that cold water, descending then in polar areas, slowly filled the
greater depths, and by carrying down a more abundant supply of oxygen, life in water
deeper than the mud-line became possible ; subsequently migrations gradually took place
from the mud-line into deep regions of the ocean basins.
