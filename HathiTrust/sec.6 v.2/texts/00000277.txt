SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Diatoms, Pyrocystis, Station 268.
Peridinium, Globigerina, Hastigerina, Pullenia, Sphæroidina, Pulvinulina, Diphyes,
Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta, Annelid larvæ, Evadne, Copilia, Corycæus, Saphirina,
Oxycephalus, Hyperids, Euphausia, Lucifer and larvæ, Sergestes, Amphion, Halobates,
small Lamellibranchs and Gasteropods, Atlanta and other Heteropods, Hyalæa
[ = Cavolinia), Spirialis [= Limacina], Styliola, Tiedemannia [= Gleba), Pteropod
larvæ, Appendicularia, Salpa. Several sharks were seen. The Pulvinulinæ and
Pulleniæ were to-day covered with a yellow-coloured sarcode, so to completely
cover and obscure the shell; in this sarcode were entangled small Diatoms,
Coccospheres, Rhabdospheres, Infusoria, and small Crustacea. Masses of yellow sarcode,
quite similar to that surrounding these Foraminifera, were frequently observed in the
tow-net gatherings, and had most probably been separated from the Pulvinulina and
Pullenix by the dragging of the net and washing of its contents into collecting bottles.
On August 31 and September 1 the fauna was found to be similar, the ship being
on these two days in the counter equatorial current, which carried her 120 miles to the
east.
