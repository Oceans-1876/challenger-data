SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Challengeride and other
Radiolaria, Ctenophore, Distomum (probably from the Euphausiæ), Cypridina,
Copepods, Hyperids and other Amphipods, Euphausia, and Pteropods. The stomachs
of the Salpæ were filled with Coccospheres, Rhabdospheres, small specimens of Peridinium,
many small yellow cells, &c. In the tow-net attached to the trawl, in addition to deep-
sea Radiolaria, red Copepods, and Cypridinas, there were large numbers of the dead
shells of pelagic Foraminifera, evidently from the bottom.

carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8.45 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 9 A.M. proceeded under steam to sound
and trawl. At 10 A.M. sounded in 2200 fathoms. Put trawl over and veered
2700 fathoms. This Station is about 220 miles distant from Station 132 on the track of
1873. Obtained serial temperatures down to 1000 fathoms. The carbonic acid was
determined in water from 800 fathoms and the bottom, and amounted respectively to 43:6
and 46.6 milligrammes per litre. At 3.30 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came
up at 4.55 P.M. with only a few specimens, having evidently been wrong side up; one of
