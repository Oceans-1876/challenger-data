condition, and very frequently with Diatoms and other minute organisms in the
interior. Not more than one or two specimens of Pyrocystis were observed in the
tow-nets during this time. Ceratium (Peridinium) tripos was also abundant, but never
observed in catena. Spherical jelly-masses, in which were minute Diatoms (Coscinodiscus
and Navicula), were very abundant, as well as Oscillatoriaceæ, Medusæ, Diphyes,
Sagitta, Aphroditacean larvæ, Evadne, numerous Copepods, Cirriped larvæ, and
Appendicularia.
Shortly after leaving Hong Kong the screw was taken up, and was found to be covered
with Tubularia, Caprella, small Copepods, and Balanus, very much like what was
observed after leaving the Cape (December 20, 1873).

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02538 ; bottom, 1.02568.
Depth, 2100 fathoms ; deposit, Blue Mud, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 6 A.M. got up steam.
At 9.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 9.30 A. M.
proceeded under steam and sounded in 2100 fathoms about half-way between Cape
Bojeador, N.W. extremity of Luzon Island, and Macclesfield Bank, and about the middle
of the China Sea. At 11 A.M. put trawl over,
At 1 P.M. obtained serial temperatures
down to 1000 fathoms. At 3.15 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up at
5 P.M. with only one Caridid shrimp and a small fish. It is probable that the trawl
never reached the bottom. Made sail.
