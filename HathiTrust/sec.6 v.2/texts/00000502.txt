Depth, 1990 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 92:54 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound and
dredge. At 9.40 A.M. sounded in 1990 fathoms. At 11 A.M. put dredge over and
veered 2600 fathoms. Took serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic
acid was determined in water from 50, 100, and 200 fathoms, and amounted respectively
to 37:3, 36-8, and 43:1 milligrammes per litre. At 4 P.M. commenced heaving in dredge,
which came up at 7 P.M. filled with deposit. Made sail.
Distance at noon from Ascension, 798 miles. Made good 123 miles. Amount of
