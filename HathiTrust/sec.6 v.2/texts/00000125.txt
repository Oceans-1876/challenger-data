Depth, 2425 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing no carbonate of lime (see
Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam. At 5.15 A.M. stopped,
and at 6 A. M. sounded in 2425 fathoms; the tube brought up a considerable quantity
of Red Clay. At 8 A.M. put over trawl. At 10 A.M. obtained serial temperatures
down to 1500 fathoms. In the forenoon sent whaler away to collect surface animals.
Sent down two pressure gauges, water-bottle, and a series of small wooden blocks
of different kinds of wood to test the effect of pressure at great depths. The carbonic
acid was determined in water from 50 fathoms, and amounted to 32.8 milligrammes
per litre. At 4.45 P.m. hove up trawl with only a few pumice-stones, some shrimps,
two fishes, and a Brachiopod on one of the pumice-stones. Made sail. Several
sooty albatrosses were seen, and one was taken with hook and line, also a few white
albatrosses, black prions, light-coloured prions, black and white petrels. A booby (Sula
fusca) alighted on one of the quarter boats and was caught. On the 7th a flock of swallows
(Hirundo gutturalis) alighted on the ropes and ports of the ship in an exhausted condition,
and four or five were caught by the hand; their stomachs were well filled with insect
remains. A thrush-like bird and several finches were also seen.
Distance at noon from No Sima lighthouse, 514 miles ; from Redfield Rocks,
448 miles. Made good 56 miles. Amount of current 4 miles, direction W.
