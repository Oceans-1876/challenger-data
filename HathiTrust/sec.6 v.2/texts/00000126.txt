THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 229.
Sergestes, crab, Zoëæ, Halobates, Ianthina, small shells, Glaucus, Atlanta, Cardiopoda,
Carinaria, Pneumonoderma, Eurybia [ = Halopsyche], Hyalæa [ = Cavolinia), Styliola,
Cleodora [= Clio] balantium, Appendicularia, Salpa, Pyrosoma, several fishes (large
Stomiatidæ and Scopelids four inches in length). A shark was caught, a female
Carcharias, six feet in length, with the tips of the fins white.
Willemoes-Suhm writes : “The tow-net brought in some very fine things. Salpæ
and Medusæ filled the water, along with very large Collosphæride. There were also
Ctenophoræ, huge specimens of Alciopa with intense black spots, small Tomopteris,
Crustacea in great abundance, especially Copepods, and Amphipods belonging to the
genera Anchylomera and Hyperia, and also Dithyrus, the coxæ of the pereiopods of
which are so singularly enlarged as to form a ventral cavity with the abdomen, and closes
up the animal entirely. Phyllosoma was very common in all stages, and will furnish
very valuable material for working out the development of the Pacific Loricata. The
specimens of Halobates were constantly smaller than the Atlantic specimens. There
were many small fishes, including Stomiatidæ with phosphorescent lateral spots, some
over two inches in length. Velella, which has seldom been taken, made its appearance,
along with its parasite Ianthina, and Porpita and Glaucus. Among the Pteropods I
found several specimens of Cleodora balantium with the animals—a Mollusc we have
never taken alive before, and is, I believe, considered to be very rare.”
