SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

STATION 230.
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books (April 5 to 8):
Oscillatoriacex, Noctiluca, Ethmodiscus, Coscinodiscus, many small Diatoms in chains,
Vorticella on Bacteriastrum, Peridinium (two species), Pyrocystis (two varieties),
Globigerina, Orbulina, Hastigerina, Pulvinulina, Acanthometræ, Polycystinæ (some
very fine specimens from tow-net sent down to 400 fathoms), Collosphæridæ, Medusa,
Velella, Porpita, Ctenophoræ, Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta, Alciopa, Tomopteris,
Sipunculid and other larvæ, curious Annelid (from tow-net sent down to 400 fathoms),
Cypridina (several species), Calanus, Saphirina, and other Copepods, Hyperids,
Phronima, Oxycephalus, Euphausia and larvæ, Lucifer, Phyllosoma, Sergestes larvæ,
small crab, small Lamellibranchs, Ethella, Atlanta, Carinaria, Pteropod larva,
Appendicularia (two varieties), Doliolum, larval Amphioxus and Scopelids with
phosphorescent spots. A male shark (Carcharias glaucus), eight feet in length, was
caught; it had four pilot fish about it. Mr Murray was away in a boat examining the
surface with a water-glass. The water was very clear; only Oscillatoriaceæ, small
Crustacea, Radiolaria, and long strings of Diatoms could be observed. Whales were
seen spouting near the ship on the evening of the 6th. The presence of Noctiluca,
larval Amphiozus, Echinoderm and Annelid larvæ, numerous small Diatoms, and
Infusoria, indicated the presence of brackish water, probably carried from the coast of
Asia by the Japan current.
