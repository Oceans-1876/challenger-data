THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
these specimens were not quite mature, the accessory nidamental glands being in fact
little developed and scarcely visible in immature individuals."
5. Laying or deposition of the eggs.—The manner in which the eggs are deposited is
unknown. We know, however, that the eggs contained in the oviduct are rather large
(Fig. R; Pl. IV. fig. 3, ov.) and with abundant vitellus, as the structure of the ovarian
ovule shows, provided with a vitelligenous follicle with multiple folds in the interior of
the eggs (Fig. V.). On the other hand, we may also infer that the eggs when once laid
are enveloped in a rather thick coating, since Spirula is provided not only with an oviducal
gland, but further with properly so-called accessory nidamental glands.
VII. CLASSIFICATION.
A dozen of different specific names have been applied to the shells of the genus
Spirula. But even in the opinion of a conchologist”: “it is impossible to determine
to which of the species (if they are distinct) the names applied to the shells belong.”
On the other hand, the number of complete specimens of Spirula, which have been
fully examined and described, is exceedingly limited (see Introduction). It results from
this that there are no means of attaching a definite value to the names originally imposed
or adopted, from the want of sufficiently distinctive characters.
In a provisional way
I propose to consider the Challenger specimen as the type of
the species Spirula peronii ; the specimen described by Owen in 1879 as the type of
the species Spirula australis (=lævis, Gray), to which the “ Blake.” specimen appears
to be related; and lastly, Professor Giard's specimen as the type of the species Spirula
reticulata (=vulgaris, Leach). So that we may establish provisionally the following
table, which further knowledge and a comparison of future specimens may possibly
modify :-
1. No distinct furrow separating the mantle from the disk. Spirula peronii
,
Lamarck (Pl. I. figs. 1-4).
2. Terminal disk separated from the mantle by a deep furrow,
A. Sub-epidermic reticulation not very distinct. Spirula australis, Lamarck
(Pl. II. figs. 1-3).
B. Sub-epidermic reticulation very marked. Spirula reticulata, Owen (Figs.
A, C, I, J, N).
