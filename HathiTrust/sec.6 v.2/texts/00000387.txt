In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-Peridinium (tripos Station 299.
and two other species), Diatoms, green circular Algæ (Halosphæra ?), small bladder-like
organisms (Noctiluca ?), Coccospheres, Globigerina, Orbulina, Pulvinulina, Acanthometra,
Polycystinæ, Challengeridæ, and compound Radiolaria, Infusoria, Medusæ, Siphonophoræ,
Sagitta, Tomopteris, Aphroditacean larvæ, Planarian larvæ, Cypridina, Hyperids and
other Amphipods, Euphausia, Heteropods, Pteropods and larvæ, larvæ of Membrani pora,
Appendicularia. A hump-back whale followed the ship for over an hour, coursing round
the ship several times, and turning on its back and side frequently when it came to the
surface ; there were bunches of Cirripeds at the blow-holes, on the dorsal fin, and on some
parts of the pectoral fins. On the 15th Globigerina were exceedingly abundant in the
surface-nets, and the pseudopodia were observed ramifying between the calcareous spines,
and projecting beyond the tips of the latter, as well as forming the bubble-like expansions
of the float. In the sarcode surrounding the Pulvinulina were numerous small Diatoms,
Peridinium, Coccospheres, and Infusoria.
