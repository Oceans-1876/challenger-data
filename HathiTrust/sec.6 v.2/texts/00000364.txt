Depth, 2270 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 5.30 A.M. proceeded under steam and
sounded in 2270 fathoms. Took serial temperatures from surface to bottom. The
carbonic acid was determined in water from 25 and 400 fathoms, and amounted respectively
to 33:1 and 44:6 milligrammes per litre. At 12.50 P.M. proceeded under steam. The
weather was calm, and as usual on such occasions very few birds were seen about the ship;
occasionally a prion, mutton bird, or Diomedea exulans, would bear in sight, course
around the ship, and soon disappear.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 1368 miles ; Juan Fernandez, 1028 miles. Made good
119 miles. Amount of current 10 miles, direction S. 11° W.

with several forms of Radiolaria (Challengeria, &c.), many small Ameboid particles, and
Infusoria. The specimens of Pulvinulina were very numerous and very fine and large,
