THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 334.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02607 ; 800 fathoms, 1•02576 ; bottom, 1.02604.
Depth, 1915 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 85.21 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8.30 A.M. got up steam, and at 9.5 A.M. shortened and furled sails and proceeded
under steam to sound and trawl. At 10 A.M. laid out trawl and veered 2600 fathoms.
At 11.15 A.M. sounded in 1915 fathoms. The sounding-tube had sunk about a foot into
the bottom, and brought up a litre of the deposit. Of this there were two layers separated
by a thin dark line, an upper layer of a dark brown colour and about eight inches in
thickness, composed essentially of the shells of pelagic Foraminifera, and a lower layer,
milk white and over an inch in thickness, chiefly made up of amorphous calcareous matter
and Coccoliths; the passage between the two layers appeared to be quite abrupt.
Obtained serial temperatures. · At 2.30 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came up
foul at 5.45 P.M., the net having got twisted round the beam, but it contained a few
specimens; the tow-nets at the weights and at the trawl contained a little of the ooze.
Made sail. Diomedea exulans, prions, mutton birds, and black night hawks were seen.
Distance at noon from Tristan da Cunha, about 310 miles ; from Ascension Island,
1685 miles. Made good 131 miles. No current.
