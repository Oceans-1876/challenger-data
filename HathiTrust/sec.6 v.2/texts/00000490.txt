Depth, 1715 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 78:38 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 11.15 A. M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound and
trawl. At 12.30 P. M. sounded in 1715 fathoms. The sounding-tube had sunk a foot
into the bottom, and brought up over a litre of the ooze; the lower layers were more
compact than the upper. Put trawl over and veered 2200 fathoms. Obtained serial
temperatures. The carbonic acid was determined in water from 400 fathoms, and
amounted to 436 milligrammes per litre. At 4.15 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl,
which came up at 5.45 P.M. bottom up, but with a shrimp entangled in the meshes of
the net. It appears that the small lead at the end of the trawl had become hitched
round the beam, the net being thus doubled up, and the shrimp was found in the fold thus
formed. In one of the tow-nets at the trawl were a great many dead empty shells of
Foraminifera which evidently came from the bottom. Made sail.
Made sail. Birds as noted at
Station 229 were seen.
Tristan da Cunha distant at noon, 865 miles. Made good 135 miles. Amount of
current 27 miles, direction S. 52º W.
