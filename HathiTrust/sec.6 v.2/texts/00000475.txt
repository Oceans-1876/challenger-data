SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
1203
At 8 A.M. got up steam, and at 8.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 9 A.m. put Station 324.
trawl over and veered 2600 fathoms. At 10.30 A.M. sounded in 2800 fathoms. Took
serial temperatures down to the bottom. The carbonic acid was determined in the
bottom (?) water, and amounted to 51.7 milligrammes per litre. At 1.20 P.M. trawl-rope
carried away, probably owing to friction against ship's side, as the rope parted close to
the ship, and the trawl and over 3000 fathoms of rope were lost. At 5 P. M. completed
observations and made sail. Albatrosses, mutton birds, black night hawks, and
Thalassidroma were seen.
Tristan da Cunha distant at noon, 1740 miles. Made good 121 miles. Amount of
current 30 miles, direction S. 56° E.
