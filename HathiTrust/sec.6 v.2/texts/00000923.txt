has thick and muscular walls, whilst that on the left is separated from the rest of the
organ by a distinct constriction, and its walls, like those of the median portion of the
stomach, are thin and semitransparent. In front of this constriction its surface appears
marked by numerous transverse striæ.
The thickening of the walls of the cardiac division is almost limited to its left
(external) side, and arises specially from the strengthening of the muscular envelope of
this region. The mucous layer of this cardiac sac is thick and spongy throughout.
The muscular covering of the right (axial) side is not much stronger than that of the
rest of the stomach.
The pyloric division has the form of an ovoid spiral sac (Pl. VI. fig. 2) united to the
stomachal cavity by a broad neck. Its internal face is marked by a deep corrugation or
depression (Pl. VI. fig. 3, a), which corresponds to a falciform prominence in the interior
of the sac.
The interior of the neck is smooth, but just where it passes into the pyloric
cæcum immense folds of the mucous membrane commence, and become more and more
strong and permanent, spreading in a slightly curved spiral over the surface of the internal
sac (Pl. VI. fig. 4) and converging on its opposite face. The surface of the folds is
itself marked by close-set oblique furrows. The junction between the pyloric division of
the stomach and the intestine is marked by only a slight fold 'representing pyloric
valve.
To the right side of the cardiac sac in Spirula peronii is attached an elongated, recurved
and whitish-looking, body (Pl. VI. fig. 3, z), with a glandular appearance, lying in
the fold of the "peritoneum,” from which arises the peduncle of the ovary ; in Spirula
reticulata this body was not seen.
The liver consists of two compact equal masses, a right and a left, which occupy the
whole space
left free by the otocysts, the salivary glands, and æsophagus, in the anterior
half of the cavity of the body (Pl. III., hp.). Each of them is produced into a posterior
lobe (Pl. VI. fig. 1), which with its corresponding lobe fills the pallial sac occupying the
last chamber of the shell (Pl. V. fig. 1, hp'.).
The two hepatic ducts run from the anterior to the posterior region of the body with
the cesophagus (Pl. III., hpd.), the one passing behind, the other in front of, the left
division of the stomach (Pl. VI. fig. 1); they unite and open into the pyloric appendage.
After having reached the stomach each tube is furnished with a great number of villous
“pancreatic” cæca (Pl. VI. figs. 1, 2). The pyloric sac of the stomach and the
pancreatic appendages of the hepatic tubes are freely surrounded by a thin transparent
membrane (Pl. III. ptn.), an invagination of the “peritoneum” or walls of the viscero-
pericardial cavity into which they thus project.
The intestine is very short and relatively wide; it arises from the left half of the
stomachal pouch. It passes downwards and forwards, on the left side of the
spire of the shell, and gradually narrows; it terminates at the anus, which is placed at
