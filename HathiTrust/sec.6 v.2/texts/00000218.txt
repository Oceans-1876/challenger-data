Depth, 3050 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.15 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound. At
6 A.M. sounded in 3050 fathoms. Lowered trawl with two tow-nets attached, but hauled
it in again after 800 fathoms had been paid out, as the weather became unfavourable for
trawling in great depths. At 7 A.M. took serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms.
The carbonic acid was determined in water from 2800 fathoms, and amounted to
37.4 milligrammes per litre. At 11.20 A.M. completed temperatures, and at 11.30 A. M.
made sail to a good westerly breeze.
Honolulu distant at noon, 1096 miles. Made good 115 miles. No current for last
two days.
Spence Bate (Zool. pt. 52) records in error Benthesicymus pleocanthus, n.g., n.sp., and
Gennadas
parvus, n.g., n.sp., from this Station ; the specimens probably came from
Station 205.
