and other Annelid larvæ, Planarians and larvæ, Evadne, Daphnia, Copepods, Cirriped
larvæ, Amphipods, Isopods, Zoëæ, small Gasteropods and Lamellibranchs, Cyphonautes,
Appendicularia.
On April 13, in Yokohama Bay, the tow-nets came up crammed with masses of small
Diatoms, in greater abundance than previously observed during the cruise, among which
were noticed a few specimens of Peridinium, Infusorians, and Medusæ. On June 6,
after the ship returned to Yokohama from a visit to the Inland Sea, there were relatively
very few Diatoms in the surface tow-nets, which contained, however, immense numbers
of small Acanthometræ, larvæ of Membranipora, small shells, Peridinium, Infusorians,
Copepods, and Cirriped larvæ. Noctiluca was present in all the hauls of the tow-net in
the bays and harbours of Japan.
Willemoes-Suhm writes: “I studied every day the development of Polygordius, from
the larva of which I got the worm in a globe; I got also Cyphonautes, the larva of a
Membranipora, and Evadne. Annelid larvæ were common, and so was a Pluteus,
Cirriped larvæ (Nauplius and Cypris stages) were abundant, and next came Copepods,
Zoëæ, and small shells with velum.”
