At 2 A.m. observed Omae Saki lighthouse on port bow, and at 6 A.m. observed land
about Iro-o-Saki. At 1 P.M. stopped and sounded in 775 fathoms. At 2 P.M. put over
trawl, veering 1000 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures. Found on sounding at
3.15 P.M. that the ship had drifted into 420 fathoms. At 3.45 P.M. commenced heaving
in trawl, which was hauled up very slowly and with great strain. At 4.45 P.M. trawl
came up, considerably damaged, the net being torn in several places. The bag contained
a quantity of stones and gravel, along with several specimens. At 5 P.M. proceeded
towards Yokohama, anchoring there at 8.40 P.M.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the trawl at this
