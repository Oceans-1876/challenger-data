of one (Styela clava) from the northern hemisphere, are from the southern temperate region, and most of them
are from between the parallels of 30° and 40° South.”i
HOYLE states that the genus Bathyteuthis, dredged by the Challenger in the Southern Ocean, has been
quite recently recorded by Verrill from the North Atlantic.?
Miers writes: "The genus Hypopeltarium (common in the Straits of Magellan, Falklands, and coasts of
Chili and Patagonia) is nearly allied to Atelecyclus, which is found both on the shores of Europe and Chili.” 3
HENDERSON enumerates the species of the genus Lithodes as follows:-
1. Northern species-
Lithodes maia, North Atlantic.
camtschaticus, Sea of Okhotsk.
brevipes, South Pacific (?); Kamtschatka.
spinosissimus, North Pacific.
agassizii, North Atlantic, deep water.
ferox, off the north-west coast of Africa, deep water.
11. Southern species —
Lithodes antarcticus, Fuegia.
murrayi, Southern Ocean.
Also the species of the genus Anapagurus as follows:--
Anapagurus chiroacanthus, Scandinavian and British Seas.
hynılmanni, British Seas.
lævis, Scandinavian and British Seas; Mediterranean, deep water.
pusillus, Azores, Canaries, Cape (?).
australiensis, New South Wales.
Henderson also writes: lunida subrugosa “may be said, indeed, to represent Munida rugosa in the
southern hemisphere. ... Of the Circumpolar Regions much remains to be learnt, but so far as is known their
Crustacean fauna is a scanty one when compared with that of the other two divisions; in some respects they
appear to gradually merge with the latter, for it has been shown that certain characteristic genera, e.g.,
Lithodes, extend almost to the tropics, but are then found only in deep water where the temperature

conditions are favourable. . . . Three new species of Lithodea were taken, all of them in the southern NORTHERN AND
hemisphere. The members of this group were formerly believed to occur only in the shallow water of the Southern Hemi-
northern and southern temperate regions, but deep-sea dredgings, more especially those of the Talisman,' SPHERES.
have shown that they extend to the tropics, in which case they are confined to deep water (some of the
species reaching a depth of over 1000 fathoms), where the temperature conditions are doubtless favourable
to their existence. As Professor A. Milne-Edwards has pointed out, this unexpected feature in their
distribution is not without interest, inasmuch as it shows the possibility of certain forms spreading from the
one circumpolar region to the other, and accommodating themselves to the altered environment, in order
to obtain the necessary conditions of temperature. . . . Numerous instances occur of abyssal species with
a greatly extended range of distribution, and of these we may cite what is perhaps the most striking.
Munidopsis antonii, which was captured by the “Talisman' off the north-west coast of Africa, was taken
by the Challenger in the Southern Ocean and off the island of Juan Fernandez, South America.” 4
SPENCE Bate writes: "The type species (of Pandalus), Pandalus annulicornis, is European, and mostly
found on the French and British coasts. Milne-Edwards records a species from the Mediterranean, Dana
one from the coast of Oregon, Dr. Stimpson several species from Madeira, Australia, and the northern shores
of Eastern Asia, Smith several from off the eastern coast of America, and Sars others from off the Scan-
dinavian shores. . . . It is interesting to notice the close approximation of this species (Palæmon affinis
from Port Jackson) to Palæmon squilla, the habitats being the antipodes of each other.” 5
