The phylogenetic relations of Spirula with other Dibranchiates may be represented
by the following table :
Octopods.
Octopods. 1
Myopsids.
Myopsids.
Ummatostrephes.
Leachia.
Egopsids.
Belemnitidze.
Spirula.
Spirulirostra.
Belem noteuthis.
1 The relations of the Octopods with the Egopsids (more archaic), and especially the group Leachia, are
demonstrated by the following facts :
1st. Certain of these last have not more than eight arms (Leachia, Chaunoteuthis, Chiroteuthis
bonplanli, adult Veranya, the Cephalopod [embryo) of Grenacher).
2nd. Cranchia and Leachia among the (Egopsids, and the generality of Octopods, are deprived of a well-
developed "resistance‚Äù apparatus.
3rd. The Octopods, like the Egopsids, have still two pairs of well-developed salivary glands.
4th. Leachia and Chiroteuthis bonplandi have no longer an infundibular valvule like the Octopods.
5th. The kidneys of the Octopods and of the Egopsids stretch only to the ventral side of the visceral sac.
6th. The Octopods and the Egopsids have two oviducts.
7th. Cranchia and Leachia have no longer any nidamental glands, like the Octopods.
8th. In the Octopods, like the (Egopsids, we find cases of hectocotylised arms on the right or on the left.
