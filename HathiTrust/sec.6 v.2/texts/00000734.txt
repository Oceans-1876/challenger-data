The following 15 genera, some of which were not taken by the Challenger, are
mentioned in the Challenger Reports as having been recorded from north and south of
the tropics, but not (or only doubtfully) from within the tropics :-
TETRACTINELLIDA :
Eunephthya.
Pallene.
Plumarella.
Русподопит. .
Asteropus.
Tanystylum.
Pachastrella.
ASTEROIDEA :
HEXACTINELLIDA :
Brisinga.
Chonelasma.
Lonchotaster.
Porania.
FISHES :
ALCYONARIA:
PYCNOGONIDA :
Gymnelis.
Acabaria.
Achelia.
Melanostigma.
It is evident that a number of these species and genera may have been already
recorded, or may yet be procured, from the tropics, but, on the other hand, it is certain
that the list of Benthos animals occurring both in high northern and high
southern latitudes, and not in the intervening tropics, could be greatly increased
had it been considered desirable to include information concerning shallow-water
organisms from other sources than the Challenger Report, to which this discussion is
limited.
