THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 246.
abundant at the surface. It has a very long tail and spines, and has been described by
Dohrn under the name of Archizoëa. (his Archizoia gigas is a larger form found in the
Antarctic and on the coast of Chili). These nauplii are more like those of a Lepadid
than of a Balanid, and as Lepas fascicularis has been floating on the surface in
quantities lately it is probable they belong to that species.”

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1·02574; bottom, 1:02568.
Depth, 2530 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, containing 10:06 per cent. of carbonate
of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
Under steam all forenoon. At 2.20 P.M. stopped and sounded in 2530 fathoms. The
upper part of the sounding-tube contained a dark red-coloured clay, about an inch in
thickness, which did not effervesce with dilute acid, while the lower part was much
lighter in colour, effervesced with acid, contained many Globigerinæ, Coccoliths, Echini
spines, as well as Diatoms and Radiolaria. The line between the two layers was very
sharply marked off by the colour, and judging from our experience in the North Pacific
the deeper layer would appear to have been formed in a depth of about 2200 fathoms,
so that there are indications here of a probable subsidence of the sea-floor. At 1 P.M.
obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined
in the bottom water, and amounted to 38.2 milligrammes per litre. At 3 P.M. completed
