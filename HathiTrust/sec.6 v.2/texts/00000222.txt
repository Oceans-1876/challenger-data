Depth, 2740 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray, and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 3 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam. At 4.30 A.M. proceeded
under steam. Put trawl over, veering 3500 fathoms. At 7 A.M. sounded in 2740 fathoms.
Obtained serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined
in bottom water, and amounted to 42.0 milligrammes per litre. At 1.10 P.M. commenced
heaving in trawl, which came up much torn at 4.20 P.M., but containing many hundreds,
of manganese nodules (the nuclei of which consisted of pumice, volcanic glass, and
Carcharodon, Oxyrhina, and Lamna teeth), and one or two living animals. Swung
ship to ascertain error of compasses, and at 6 P.m. proceeded under steam. Albatrosses
and stormy petrels were seen.
Honolulu distant at noon, 1002 miles. Made good 57 miles. Amount of current
14 miles, direction N. 43° E.
ANIMALS FROM
TRAWL.
The following species are recorded in the Zoological Reports from the trawl
at this Station :
ISOPODA (Beddard, Zool. pt. 48).
Eurycope intermedia, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained at no other locality.
SCHIZOPODA (Sars, Zool. pt. 37).
Boreomysis obtusata, n.sp. One specimen ; obtained also at Station 232.
In addition to the foregoing, a fragment of arm of Brisinga and backbone of small
fish were attached to the trawl-net, and Professor Thomson remarks that a small starfish,
probably a Hymenaster, fell off the net as the trawl was being taken in.
