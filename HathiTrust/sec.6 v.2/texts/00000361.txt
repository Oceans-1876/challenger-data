Depth, 2025 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 44:68 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 5.30 A.M.
sounded in 2025 fathoms. In this, as in the last Station, the deposit, though a Globigerina
Ooze, was of a dark brown colour, which was due to the large quantity of the peroxides
of iron and manganese. Associated with the Foraminiferous shells were very many
fragments of basic volcanic rocks. Some of the manganese nodules had a nucleus of
hard black volcanic glass (sideromelan), which was surrounded by a zone of 'altered
material (palagonite). At 7 A.M. put trawl over and veered 2500 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in traw),
which came up at 3 P.M. with several specimens, about a dozen manganese nodules, and
two sharks' teeth. Made all plain sail. The following birds were noticed :-Diomedea
erulans (two large white ones remained near the ship, and twice or thrice took the hook,
but were not landed on board), molly mauks (Diomedea melanophrys ?), Procellaria
capensis, mutton birds, several petrels rather less in size than the Cape pigeon but with
longer wings, and a large petrel-like bird less than the molly mauk.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 1661 miles. Made good 141 miles. Amount of current
6 miles, direction S.
