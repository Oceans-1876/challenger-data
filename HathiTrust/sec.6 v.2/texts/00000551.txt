1. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN THE ZONE DEEPER
THAN 2500 FATHOMS.
The Challenger trawled or dredged at 25 Stations where the depth was 2500 fathoms
and over, about 600 specimens of invertebrates and fishes being procured, belonging
to about 235 species and about 200 genera.
A number of these specimens were so
mutilated when hauled on board that they were not preserved; others though brought
home did not reach the hands of the specialists preparing the Challenger Reports, or
were not in a condition to be described. The total number of species and genera
actually described and recorded in the Zoological Reports from these depths amounts to
161 species and 127 genera, of which 140 species (or 87 per cent of the total number
of species recorded in the Reports) and 50 genera (or 39 per cent.) are new to science, as
shown in the following list. Those species taken by the Challenger in this zone only
(numbering 96 species, or 60 per cent.) are indicated by an asterisk thus. * The
geographical distribution of the species is indicated by the heavy letters S, T, and N,
used to denote that the species was taken south of the tropic of Capricorn (S), between
the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer (T), or north of the tropic of Cancer (N).
