and larvæ, Brachyurous Zoëæ, Cleodora [ :- Clio), Cuvierina, Hyalæa [ = Cavolinia),
Styliola, small Cephalopod with ten arms (over an inch in length), Appendicularia,
Fritillaria, Doliolum, Salpa (with Coccospheres, &c., in the stomach), Leptocephalus,
Stomiatidæ. The tow-nets from the surface were filled with Diatoms and Noctilucæ,
making the water quite thick when placed in the globes, whereas two tow-nets sent down
to 900 and 1000 fathoms contained fewer Noctilucæ and Diatoms, and the water in the
globes remained clear. Sometimes the ship appeared to be passing through patches of
greenish water, in which Noctiluca, numerous Diatoms, and larval forms indicating
brackish water were rather abundant, but these were quite absent from the surrounding
deep blue water.
