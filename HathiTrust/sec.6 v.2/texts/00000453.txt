was of a green colour, doubtless arising from the presence of great numbers of Diatoms
(chiefly Coscinodiscus). In Stanley Harbour the tow-net yielded immense numbers of
small beautiful Medusæ.

Depth, 1035 fathoms; deposit, Sandy Gravel, containing 14:61 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 9 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam to sound and trawl.
At 9.30 A.M. stopped and sounded in 1035 fathoms. The sounding-tube contained no
trace of the bottom. At 11 A.M. put trawl over and veered 1600 fathoms. Took serial
temperatures down to 500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom water,
and amounted to 38.5 milligrammes per litre. At 3 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl,
but at 3.55 P.m. trawl-rope carried away after the weights had come in. The rope
appeared much chafed, indicating the probable stony nature of the bottom. In the
tow-net attached to the weights were found a few specimens and some of the deposit,
