SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE OCEAN. (Map 1.)
Of all oceans the South Atlantic is the one containing fewest islands, and it is
traversed by virtually the same winds at all seasons of the year. In that ocean, accord-
ingly, the distribution of the specific gravity of the surface is presented in its simplest
form. From the equator to the estuary of the Rio de la Plata the prevailing winds are
south-easterly trades. It is also to be noted that these winds blow from higher to lower
altitudes, and consequently from regions of lower to regions of higher temperatures (see
Map 2). From these conditions result a drier atmosphere, increased evaporation from
the surface of the sea, and a small rainfall, much smaller than would otherwise be, owing
to the almost total absence of islands which would, in proportion to their height,
condense the aqueous vapour into rain, and thus lower the specific gravity in this
Hence, the specific gravity increases on nearing the South American coast,
attaining the maximum, 1.0275 to 1.0278, from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Off the west
coast of Africa, in the same latitudes, specific gravity is much lower, even though that
coast, from lat. 10Â° to 304 S., is one of the driest regions of the globe, much drier,
indeed, than the corresponding coast of Brazil. This is due to the fact that the
prevailing westerly winds on that coast are but the in-draught from the sea towards the
heated land of Africa, and, necessarily, owing to the distribution of pressure, they extend
only a short distance westwards into the Atlantic. Further, as the whole wind-system,
together with the surface currents of this portion of the South Atlantic, is drifted west-
ward by the south-east trades, there is an upwelling along the more easterly portion of
the ocean to make good the surface drain, and the specific gravity of this deep water
brought to the surface is much lower than that of the surface waters to the westward
owing to the large evaporation of this region, to which these surface waters are subjected
during their long course over this ocean.
On the other hand, the North Atlantic presents features strikingly different.
considerable portion of the year northerly and north-westerly winds set in on the north-
west coast of Africa, and, since they have traversed a considerable extent of the Atlantic,
and have been steadily advancing into warmer latitudes, that region is characterised
by a specific gravity higher than anything observed off the coast of South Africa. Again,
the north-east trades do not blow home on the shores of the Eastern States of America
On the contrary, the north-east winds from the anticyclone of the North Atlantic curve
