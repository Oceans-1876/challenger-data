the ship.
Mr. Murray went away in a boat and picked up a good many Ianthinæ, on which
Lepas was growing, and on the Lepas were Acineta and small Aphroditaceans. He also
took specimens of Porpita and Physalia ; under the latter he observed two species of
small blue fishes, one with stripes of blue and white, and they were generally taken in
the net along with Physalia. Some smaller fishes were seen, and many specimens of
Collosphæra were floating on the surface. Halobates was abundant. Some pieces of
wood were noticed on the surface, and the presence of Evadne, Annelid larvæ, the
numerous Peridinia and Infusoria, appeared to indicate some drift from land.
