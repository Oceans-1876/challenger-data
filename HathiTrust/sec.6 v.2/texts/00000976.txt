THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.

Sea, the specific gravity of the Arabian Sea is high, but everywhere else to the north of
lat. 10° S. it is rather low, owing no doubt to the large and, over wide areas, heavy rain-
fall occurring there. For a considerable portion of the year the prevailing winds of West
and North Australia are from the sea, where barometric pressure is much higher than in
the interior of the continent, and consequently the specific gravity is higher for some
distance round these coasts. Similarly, over the western half of this ocean the prevail-
ing winds blow home on the coast of Southern Africa, in the interior of which in the same
months pressure is also low, and, just as happens off South America, the specific gravity
is largest on the coast to the south of the latitude of Madagascar, which lies quite open to
the ocean.
The deflection of the lines round the South African coast is very interest-
ing in connection with the well-known warm and cold ocean currents which are so strik-
ing a feature of that part of the globe. Fortunately, these lines are drawn from good
annual mean specific gravities, calculated from numerous observations made during each
of the twelve months of the year, which have been published by the Meteorological
Council. It will be observed that the highest specific gravities of the Indian Ocean
are found in the region of the anticyclones of that ocean, just as occurs with respect to
the other occans, particularly the Pacific Ocean.
The lower specific gravities observed in central Atlantic, between the higher specific
gravities of the North and South Atlantic, are also annual averages, based on numerous
observations, and mark with great distinctness the region between the two trade
winds. It will be observed that in this region from long. 30° W. the specific gravity
constantly diminishes eastward to the head of the Gulf of Guinea, where it falls below
1•0260, being lower than occurs anywhere on the coasts from the English Channel to
the Cape of Good Hope.
The region of lowest specific gravity anywhere hitherto observed is the southern
part of the Sea of Okhotsk where the mean falls to 1.0240, as calculated from numerous
observations made there by Admiral Makaroff on board the “ Vitiaz," and the next
lowest between Greenland and Spitzbergen, where Professor Mohn, also from numerous
observations, gives the low mean specific gravity of 1.0245. The mean of the ten
observations made by the Challenger to the south of lat. 60° S. is 1.0247, and of the
six of these made near to or to the south of the line of 1.0245 on Map 1, the mean
is 1.0245, being the same as Mohn's line of least mean specific gravity. The low specific
gravities round the southern part of South America are occasioned, on the west coast
chiefly, by the heavy rainfall of that region, and on the east coast, in addition to the
rainfall, by the upwelling there resulting from the strong westerly winds blowing from
the land seawards.
