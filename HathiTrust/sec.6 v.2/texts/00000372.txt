Depth, 1825 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 64:34 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A. M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 5.30 A.M.
sounded in 1825 fathoms. Two layers were noticeable in the sounding-tube, a straw-
coloured upper layer and a dark brown lower layer, which latter contained much manganese
and very little carbonate of lime. Put trawl over and veered 2300 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures from surface to bottom. The carbonic acid was determined in bottom
water and amounted to 447 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in
trawl, which came up at 2.20 P.M. containing a few specimens and a little deposit, while
the attached tow-nets were filled with ooze. At 3 P.M. made sail. Diomedea exulans,
Diomedea melanophrys (?), Procellaria gigantea, Procellaria capensis, mutton birds,
Prion turtur, and several small Thalassidromas were seen.
Juan Fernandez distant at noon, 510 miles. Made good 124 miles. Amount of
current 17 miles, direction S. 30° W.
