The greater abundance of species and individuals procured on the Terrigenous deposits
is thus clearly shown when compared with those captured on the Pelagic deposits, such
as the red clays and organic oozes, excepting those of the Southern Ocean. The hauls
with the trawl are, it will be noted, much more productive than those with the dredge.
The trawlings in the Southern Ocean are remarkable for the large number of species Trawlings IN THE
procured on all the different kinds of deposits in all depths and at great distances from
continental land. This may be accounted for by the continental conditions being carried
far to the north as above suggested, but it appears to me to be likewise due to the
greater abundance of food that falls to the bottom in this region, arising from the
large numbers of Plankton organisms frequently killed at the surface owing to the
mixing which takes place in these latitudes of surface currents from different sources
and of very different temperatures. There is a parallel to this in the Northern
Atlantic and Northern Pacific, though, owing to the distribution of the land masses,
