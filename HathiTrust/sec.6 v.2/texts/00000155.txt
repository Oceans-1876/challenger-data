Depth, 2675 fathoms; deposit, Blue Mud, containing only a trace of carbonate of
lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5 A.M. stopped and sounded in 2675 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures
down to 300 fathoms. At 9.10 A.M. completed temperatures and proceeded under sail ;
Oosima lighthouse about 39 miles N.E. The surface temperatures observed indicated the
presence of the Japan stream during the whole of the day. Black albatrosses, black
petrels, and several swallows about the ship.
The following species are recorded in error from this Station, having evidently come
