STATION 314.
Station 344 (Sounding 494), off Ascension (see Chart 43).
April 3, 1876 ; lat. 7° 54' 20" S., long. 14° 28' 20" W.
Temperature of air at noon, 81°:8; mean for the day, 80°:5.
Temperature of water at surface, 82°:0.
Density at 60° F. at surface, 1.02658.
Depth, 420 fathoms; deposit, Calcareous Volcanic Sand, containing 71:65 per cent.
of carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5.30 A.M. weighed anchor and proceeded out of Clarence Bay to swing ship for
errors of compass and needle. At noon sounded in 420 fathoms; the sounding-tube
brought up a few pieces of dead shells and Corals. At 1 P.M. put dredge over and veered
700 fathoms. At 1.30 P. M. commenced heaving in dredge, which came up at 2 P. M. with
numerous specimens, mostly attached to the swabs. A little sand was obtained in the
dredge and attached tow-net; many of the rock fragments, shells, and Corals were quite
black from a coating of manganese. Made sail and proceeded towards St. Vincent,
Cape Verdes, distant about 1400 miles. One or two small Thalassidromas and a large
flock of wide-awakes were seen.
