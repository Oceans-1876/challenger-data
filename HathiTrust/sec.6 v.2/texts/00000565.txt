Notes on the Geographical Distribution. --An examination of the foregoing list shows
that of the 262 species taken in this zone between 2000 and 2500 fathoms, 133 species
(or 51 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 122 species (or 47 per cent.)
were taken within the tropics, and 99 species (or 38 per cent.) were taken north of the
northern tropic; while 23 species (or 9 per cent.) were found to be common to all those
three areas, 11 species (or 4 per cent.) were common to the southern and northern areas,
22 species (or 8 per cent.) were common to the southern and tropical areas, and 13
species (or 5 per cent.) were common to the tropical and northern areas.
3. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN DEPTHS BETWEEN
1500 AND 2000 FATHOMS.
The Challenger dredged or trawled at 32 Stations where the depth was between 1500
and 2000 fathoms, about 1250 specimens of invertebrates and fishes being procured,
belonging to about 500 species and about 345 genera. The total number of species and
genera actually described and recorded in the Zoological Reports from the zone between
these depths amounts to 412 species, of which 348 (or 84 per cent.) are new to science,
belonging to 272 genera, of which 105 (or 39 per cent.) are new to science, as shown in
the following list. Those species taken by the Challenger in this zone only (numbering
249 species, or 60 per cent.) are indicated by an asterisk thus. * The geographical dis-
tribution of the species is indicated by the heavy letters S, T, and N, used to denote
that the species was taken south of the tropic of Capricorn (S), between the tropics of
Capricorn and Cancer (T), or north of the tropic of Cancer (N).
