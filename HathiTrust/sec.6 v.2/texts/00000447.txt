sounding-tube. Took serial temperatures. The carbonic acid was determined in surface
water, and amounted to 42:9 milligrammes per litre. Put over trawl, which came up at
10.15 A.M. empty. Owing to a strong northerly current, it probably did not touch the
bottom. At 10.30 A.M. made sail.
Jason West Cay distant at noon, 22 miles. Made good 135 miles.
The Challenger remained at the Falkland Islands from January 23 till February 6, 1876,
during which time several dredgings and trawlings were taken from the steam pinnace
and from the ship in Port William, Port Louis, &c., in from 4 to 12 fathoms (Stations 315
and 316). The deposit in Stanley Harbour, in 6 fathoms, was a Blue Mud containing
39:12 per cent. of carbonate of lime (for description of the islands see Narr. Chall.
Exp., vol. i. pp. 883–894). The following species are recorded in the Zoological
Reports as having been obtained during the visit, the depth and locality being
indicated :
