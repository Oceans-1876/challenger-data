THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
STATION 281.
Depth, 2385 fathoms ; deposit, Red Clay, with very many crystals of phillipsite
formed in situ at the bottom, containing only a trace of carbonate of lime
(see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 5 A.M. shortened and furled sail, and proceeded under steam to sound. At 5.40 A.M.
sounded in 2385 fathoms; the sounding-tube brought up no trace of the bottom. Put
over trawl and veered 2900 fathoms. At 10 A.M. obtained serial temperatures down to
1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from 200 fathoms, and
amounted to 43.2 milligrammes per litre. At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl,
which came up at 3.30 P.M. with several specimens. The bag contained about two
gallons of Red Clay, between two and three bushels of manganese nodules, slabs of
volcanic tufa covered with manganese, over a hundred sharks' teeth, and six tympanic and
three petrous bones of Cetaceans. The enamel of one of the Carcharodon teeth was over
four inches in length along the edge, and was as large as, if not larger than, any of the
specimens of Carcharodon megalodon procured in Tertiary deposits from different parts
of the world. Made sail.
Distance at noon from Tubuai Island, 75 miles; from Rurutu Island, 61 miles. Made
good 82 miles. Amount of current 24 miles, direction S. 23° W.
