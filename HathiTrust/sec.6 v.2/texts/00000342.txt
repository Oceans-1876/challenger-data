Depth, 1985 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 65.81 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 6 A.M. sounded
in 1985 fathoms. Put over trawl and veered 2500 fathoms. Obtained serial temperatures
down to 1500 fathoms. The carbonic acid was determined in water from 200, 800, and
1975 fathoms, and amounted respectively to 35.8, 46-2, and 51.2 milligrammes per litre.
At 1 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl, but at 2.30 P. M. the trawl-rope carried away,
and
the trawl with its contents, apparently heavy, and 2000 fathoms of line, were lost.
Made all plain sail and proceeded. One or two large albatrosses (Diomedea exulans)
were seen.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 3608 miles ; Bass Islands about 120 miles. Made good
87 miles. Amount of current 13 miles, direction N.
