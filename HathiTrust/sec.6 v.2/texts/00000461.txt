of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. proceeded under steam and sail, the wind having fallen off. At 8.30 A. M.
shortened and furled sails. At 9 A.M. stopped and sounded in 600 fathoms; the sounding-
tube contained only a small phosphatic concretion. Put trawl over. Obtained serial
temperatures down to bottom. At 11.30 A. M. commenced heaving in trawl, which came
up at 12.30 P.M. containing a little mud, five or six phosphatic concretions, and
numerous specimens. This was one of the richest hauls made during the cruise. At
2 P.M. proceeded under steam and sail.
Lobos Island distant at noon, 144 miles. Made good 110 miles. Amount of current
17 miles, direction S. 5° W.
