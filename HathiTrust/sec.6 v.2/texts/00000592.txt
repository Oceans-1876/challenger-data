Notes on the Geographical Distribution.—An examination of the foregoing list shows
that of the 508 species taken in this zone between 1000 and 1500 fathoms, 231 species
(or 44 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 194 species (or 38 per cent.)
were taken within the tropics, and 267 species (or 53 per cent.) were taken north of the
northern tropic; while 38 species (or 8 per cent.) were found to be common to all those
three areas, 29 species (or 6 per cent.) were common to the southern and northern areas,
27 species (or 5 per cent.) were common to the southern and tropical areas, and 49
species (or 10 per cent.) were common to the tropical and northern areas.
5. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN DEPTHS BETWEEN 500
AND 1000 FATHOMS.
The Challenger dredged or trawled at 23 Stations where the depth was between 500
and 1000 fathoms, about 2000 specimens of invertebrates and fishes being procured,
belonging to about 710 species and about 425 genera. The total number of species and
genera actually described and recorded in the Zoological Reports from the zone between
these depths amounts to 631 species and 363 genera, of which 501 species (or about 80
per cent.) and 95 genera (or 26 per cent.) are new to science, as shown in the following
list. Those species taken by the Challenger in this zone only (numbering 406 species or
64 per cent.) are indicated by an asterisk thus.* The geographical distribution of the
species is indicated by the heavy letters, S, T, and N, used to denote that the species
