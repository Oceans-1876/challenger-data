THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Notes on the Geographical Distribution.--An examination of the foregoing list shows
that of the 412 species taken in this zone between 1500 and 2000 fathoms, 274 species
(or 67 per cent.) were taken south of the southern tropic, 101 species (or 25 per cent.)
were taken within the tropics, and 137 species (or 33 per cent.) were taken north of the
northern tropic; while 30 species (or 7 per cent.) were found to be common to all those
three areas, 18 species (or 4 per cent.) were common to the southern and northern areas,
13 species (or 3 per cent.) were common to the tropical and northern areas, and 20
species (or 5 per cent.) were common to the southern and tropical areas.
4. ANIMALS OBTAINED IN THE DREDGINGS AND TRAWLINGS IN DEPTHS BETWEEN 1000
AND 1500 FATHOMS.
The Challenger dredged or trawled at 25 Stations where the depth was between 1000
and 1500 fathoms, about 2000 specimens being procured, belonging to about 600 species
and about 400 genera. The total number of species and genera actually described and
recorded in the Zoological Reports from the zone between these depths amounts to 508
species and 327 genera, of which 365 species (or 72 per cent.) and 83 genera (or 25 per
cent.) are new to science, as shown in the following list. Those species taken by the
Challenger in this zone only (numbering 277 species, or 55 per cent.) are indicated by an
asterisk thus.* The geographical distribution of the species is indicated by the heavy letters
S, T, and N, used to denote that the species was taken south of the tropic of Capricorn
(S), between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer (T), or north of the tropic of Cancer (N).
