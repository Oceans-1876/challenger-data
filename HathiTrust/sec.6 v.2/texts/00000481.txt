In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books from the tow-nets at the Station 326.
surface and down to 50 fathoms :--Peridinium tripos, Globigerina, Acanthometræ and
compound Radiolaria, Carchesium, Medusæ, Beroë, Echinoderm larvæ, Sagitta, Alciopa,
Aphroditacean larvæ, Planarians, Cypridina, Hyperids, Zoëæ of Decapods, Archizoca,
Atlanta, Firoloida, Limacina and other Pteropods, Cymbulia Jarvæ, Membranipora
larvæ, Appendicularia, and many specimens of a stage of Doliolum, which gave the
tow-net a slight reddish appearance. The tow-net sent down to 50 fathoms contained a
number of Globigerina, which were not noticed in the surface hauls, and several organisms
apparently indicating the presence of shore or river water, such as Echinoderm larvæ,
Membrani pora larvæ, Planarians, Carchesium, and Aphroditacean larvæ.

Density at 60° F. at surface, 1:02633 ; bottom, 1·02614.
Depth, 2900 fathoms; deposit, Red Clay, containing no carbonate of lime (see
Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 1.30 P.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam, and at 2.30 P.M.
sounded in 2900 fathoms. Over a litre of the deposit was obtained in the sounding-tube,
the upper layers having a dark slate colour, while the lower layers had a tinge of red and
were more compact. Obtained serial temperatures. At 5 P.M. completed observations,
and at 5.20 P.M. made sail. Albatrosses, black petrels, and another petrel were seen.
Tristan da Cunha distant at noon, 1462 miles. Made good 89 miles. Amount of
current for the past two days 26 miles, direction S. 70° E.
