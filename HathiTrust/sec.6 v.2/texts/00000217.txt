P TEROPODA (Pelseneer, Zool. pt. 65).
Cavolinia gibbosa (Rang).
In addition, the following are recorded in the note-books :-A few Oscillatoriaceæ,
Coccospheres, Rhabdospheres, Orbulina, Pulvinulina, Radiolaria, Sagitta, Copepods,
Cirripeds and Zoëæ, Euphausia, larval Gasteropods, Heteropods, and Pteropods.
Many balls of Cirripeds and large Rhizostoma were in the surface water. On the
Cirriped balls were Nudibranchs, Aphroditaceans, Cymothoa, and Halobates. The
stomachs of the Cirriped Zoëæ were filled with Coccospheres, Coccoliths, Rhabdospheres,
and Rhabdoliths, and the dung of the Zoëæ was abundant in the water, about 1 mm. in
length, tapering towards both ends, of a yellow colour, and composed of a mass of these
small Algæ, Diatoms, &c. The stomachs of the Euphausiæ contained chiefly the remains
