THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
At the 100 fathoms depth the temperature conditions have materially altered. As
regards the entrance to the Gulf, it is within the North Atlantic isothermal of 65°, but
over the Gulf itself temperature, to the west of long. 90° W., falls below 60°, and over
a small region between that line and the continent it falls to 55°. Here, then,
observation gives no evidence that the dense surface waters descend to any great depth
carrying with them their high temperature downward. The evidence, on the contrary,
goes to show that the strong surface current issuing through the Straits of Bemini, with
the deeper current it generates, drains away, to a very large extent, the whole of the
warm dense waters of the surface, thus bringing about an upwelling of colder water in
the western part of the Gulf, so that the temperature there is 15° lower than it is
immediately to the south-west of Cuba. Unfortunately, no specific gravities have
been available at this and lower depths in the Gulf of Mexico, which would probably
show a diminished specific gravity corresponding to the diminished temperature.
Three specific gravities have, however, been observed in the western part of
the Atlantic, viz., 1.0278, 1•0278 and 1.0274, which may be regarded as pointing to a
mixing of the higher surface specific gravities of the Gulf of Mexico with the water
of the Atlantic at this depth.
The relation of the temperature of the west of the Gulf of Mexico to that of the
Atlantic continues to hold at greater depths till the temperature falls at 700 fathoms to
39º.5, at which depth the Gulf of Mexico becomes “a closed sea,” and the temperature
remains at this point down to the greatest depth, 2067 fathoms, of the Gulf of
Mexico. The following gives a comparison of the lowest temperature in the Gulf of
Mexico and the temperature at the entrance to the Gulf at the different depths :

These facts point to a strong upwelling of the deep waters in the western division
of the Gulf of Mexico, necessitated by the strong current which issues from it, and which
extends to a considerable depth in the ocean. This view is borne out by the fact that
the Atlantic easterly current is there embayed before starting to join the Atlantic north-
eastern current on its way towards the Arctic Ocean, and southerly and south-
westerly winds become prevalent, thus inducing upwelling in the western part of the Gulf.
It has been calculated that, owing to the heaping up of the waters driven by the
