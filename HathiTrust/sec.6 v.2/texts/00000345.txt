Depth, 2075 fathoms ; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 46:61 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 8 A.M. got up steam.
At 9 A.M. shortened and furled sails. At 10 A.M. sounded
in 2075 fathoms. Nearly a foot of the deposit came up in the tube, the upper
surface
being a light yellow Globigerina Ooze; passing down the tube the ooze became gradually
darker, till at the bottom there was a dark chocolate coloured clay containing rounded
pellets of manganese and many yellow crystals of phillipsite. Obtained serial temperatures
down to 1500 fathoms. At 12.55 P.M. completed observations and made sail.
A large
albatross (Diomedea exulans), large black or brown petrels, another petrel of a lighter
colour, and five or six apparently land-birds, like plovers, were seen.
