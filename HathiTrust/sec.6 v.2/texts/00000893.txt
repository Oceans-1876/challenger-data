EDITORIAL NOTE.
A short time ago Professor Giard placed two specimens of the rare
Cephalopod Spirula in the hands of Dr Paul Pelseneer for anatomical
examination. From a study of these specimens, and with the assistance
of Mr Huxley's figures and notes, Dr Pelseneer has been able to prepare the
following important Report.
The figures contained in the six plates which illustrate this Memoir
are copies of the drawings made by Mr Huxley in the course of his
examination of the Challenger specimen of Spirula, and of that kindly lent
him by Mr Agassiz.
Finding himself unable to carry out the work he had taken in hand to
his satisfaction, Mr Huxley placed the plates at Dr Pelseneer's disposal,
and gladly supplied him with such information as it was in his power
to give.
Although Mr Huxley thinks that Dr Pelseneer has really been the sole
author of the Memoir, he has, at Dr Pelseneer's desire, allowed his name to
appear in the title.
This Report forms the eighty-third and last Part of the Zoological Series
of Reports on the Scientific Results of the Expedition, and, owing to the
delay in its preparation, could not be issued in one of the Zoological volumes.
The manuscript in French was received by me from Dr Paul Pelseneer
in January 1894, and was translated into English by Miss Annie Sclater.
