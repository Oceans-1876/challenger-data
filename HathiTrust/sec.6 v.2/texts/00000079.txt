SUMMARY OF RESULTS.
849
On the afternoon of the 21st Mr. Murray went away in the dingey and visited Station 216a.
several patches of floating driftwood, of which much had been observed on the surface
during the past two days. Under the drift three or four varieties of small fishes and
small slate-coloured crabs were captured by means of a scoop-net. The pieces of drift-
wood were covered with small specimens of Lepas; the arm of a cuttlefish (Histioteuthis)
was picked up, and a sea-snake (Pelamys bicolor), three feet in length, was captured
alive and brought on board. Several kinds of sea-weeds and fruits were also collected
among the driftwood.? In some places there were large patches of Collosphæra and other
Radiolaria, and a number of birds (Phalaropus hyperboreus) appeared to be feeding on
them ; wherever these patches of Collosphæra occurred the sea had an oily appearance.
A Balistes was noticed among the fishes, and sharks were evidently feeding on the
small fishes. Boobies alighted and sat
upon
the driftwood. The presence of
Peridinium, Noctiluca, Diatoms, Annelid and other larvæ, as well as the driftwood,
indicated fresh water, apparently derived from some large river in New Guinea. A
school of porpoises came near the ship and lay lazily at the surface.
