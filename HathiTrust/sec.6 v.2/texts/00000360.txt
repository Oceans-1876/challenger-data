THE VOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.
Station 292.
At 1.15' P.M. shortened and furled sails, and proceeded under steam. At 2 P.M.
sounded in 1600 fathoms. The sounding-tube had sunk several inches into the deposit
and brought up half a litre of the ooze, which was of a brown colour, but on shaking up
in water the Foraminifera separated from the red amorphous matter and settled as a
white layer at the bottom of the glass. There were a great many particles of palagonite
and other volcanic matter, as well as numerous small particles of peroxide of manganese,
many of the Foraminifera being studded with grains of this substance. The association
of the basic volcanic materials with the manganese in this Globigerina Ooze is suggestive
of the origin of the manganese. Put trawl over and veered 2100 fathoms. Obtained
serial temperatures down to the bottom. The carbonic acid was determined in water
from the surface, and amounted to 36:6 milligrammes per litre. At 6 P.M. commenced
beaving in trawl, but at 7.40 P.M. the trawl-rope carried away, and the trawl, tow-nets,
and 1600 fathoms of line were lost. Made all plain sail. The usual birds were
noticed, and one of the mutton birds was caught.
Valparaiso distant at noon, 2022 miles. Made good 162 miles. Amount of current
13 miles, direction N. 13° E.
