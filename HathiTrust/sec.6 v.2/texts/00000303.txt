Depth, 2600 fathoms ; deposit, Radiolarian Ooze, containing 10:19 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails and got up steam to sound. At 5.30 A.M.
sounded in 2600 fathoms. At 7.30 A. M. put trawl over and veered 3200 fathoms. Took
serial temperatures down to 1500 fathoms. At 2 P.M. commenced heaving in trawl,
which came up at 5.40 P. M. with several specimens, a rounded piece of pumice slightly
impregnated with manganese, and two or three irregular manganese nodules with nuclei
of pumice. At 6 P.M. made all plain sail. Frigate birds and boatswain birds were seen,
supposed to be fishing for flying-fish.
Venus Point, Tahiti, distant at noon, 846 miles. Made good 88 miles. Amount of
current 44 miles, direction W.
