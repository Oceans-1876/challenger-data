at which the influence of season is no longer felt on the open ocean. This
depth was provisionally fixed at 100 fathoms, and it is of importance to note
that at this and greater depths each observation of temperature and specific
gravity may be treated as a good annual mean.
The second part of the Report examines the temperatures and specific
gravities at depths from 100 fathoms to the bottom, their relations to the tem-
peratures, specific gravities, and currents near the surface, and the horizontal
and vertical movements of the ocean in this way indicated. The results, so
far as now ascertained, point unmistakably to the necessity for further ex-
ploration of the Southern Ocean, the western half of the South Atlantic, and
the Pacific from about long. 150° W. to the American coasts, before com-
pletely satisfactory explanations can be given for some of the phenomena
pointed out in the Memoir.
It will be seen, however, that Dr. Buchan has made a most important
contribution to knowledge, which will be welcomed by all who take an
interest in the science of the sea.
The Report is illustrated by sixteen double-page maps. The manuscript
was received by me in December 1894.
