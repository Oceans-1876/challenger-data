Depth, 2025 fathoms; deposit, Globigerina Ooze, containing 88.97 per cent. of
carbonate of lime (see Murray and Renard, Deep-Sea Deposits Chall. Exp.).
At 4.30 A.M. shortened and furled sails, and got up steam. At 5 A.M. proceeded under
steam to sound and trawl. At 5.30 A. M. sounded in 2025 fathoms. The sounding-tube
had sunk about a foot into the deposit, but contained only a small quantity of the ooze.
Laid out trawl and veered 2600 fathoms. Took serial temperatures. The carbonic acid
was determined in water from 100 fathoms and bottom, and amounted respectively to
37.2 and 44:5 milligrammes per litre. At 11.30 A.M. commenced heaving in trawl. This
Station is about 17 miles to the westward of Station 133 of October 11, 1873. Having
